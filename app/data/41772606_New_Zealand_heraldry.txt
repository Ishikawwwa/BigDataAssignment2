New Zealand heraldry is the term for the style of armorial achievements, sometimes known as coats of arms, and other heraldic bearings and insignia used in New Zealand. It largely follows the Gallo-British tradition of heraldry also followed in England, Scotland, Ireland, Canada and Australia. Most grants of heraldic arms to New Zealand residents or institutions have been made by the English College of Arms or the Scottish Court of the Lord Lyon, though a small number have also been granted by the Chief Herald of Ireland and the State Herald of South Africa. == Heraldic authority == New Zealand does not presently have its own independent heraldic authority which grants or records arms, though the College of Arms in London claims to be "the official heraldic authority for...New Zealand". According to the guidelines of the Cabinet Manual, the College has been delegated these responsibilities by the Sovereign of New Zealand in their capacity as the "Fount of all Honour". However, the legal basis for this "official" status for the College of Arms is disputed. On 6 February 1978 Queen Elizabeth II established the New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary as the officer of arms responsible for advising the Crown, New Zealand government and New Zealand Defence Force on heraldic matters, and for liaising between New Zealand and the English College of Arms. Although affiliated with the College of Arms, the New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary lives and works in New Zealand, and is not a member of the College Chapter. The current New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary is Phillip Patrick O’Shea. == Coats of arms == The heraldry of New Zealand has added indigenous animals (mostly birds) to the existing heraldic bestiary, along with native flora and traditional Māori motifs. ===National arms=== File:Coat of arms of New Zealand.svg|Coat of arms of New Zealand (1956-Present) File:Arms of New Zealand.svg|Coat of arms of New Zealand, escutcheon only File:Coat of arms of New Zealand (1911–1956).svg| Coat of arms of New Zealand (1911–1956) ===Civic arms=== Some, but not all, local authorities in New Zealand use heraldic arms. The arms of the capital, Wellington, combines the arms of Aurthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington with the national coat of arms. The coat of arms of the City of Christchurch also have charges from the national arms. Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand, does not currently use any arms. The unauthorised use of a coat of arms of a local authority can be an offense.
