In Euclidean geometry, the Neuberg cubic is a special cubic plane curve associated with a reference triangle with several remarkable properties. It is named after Joseph Jean Baptiste Neuberg (30 October 1840 â€“ 22 March 1926), a Luxembourger mathematician, who first introduced the curve in a paper published in 1884. The curve appears as the first item, with identification number K001, in Bernard Gilbert's Catalogue of Triangle Cubics which is a compilation of extensive information about more than 1200 triangle cubics. ==Definitions== thumb|Neuberg cubic of triangle showing one of the defining properties of an arbitrary point on the curve The Neuberg cubic can be defined as a locus in many different ways. One way is to define it as a locus of a point in the plane of the reference triangle such that, if the reflections of in the sidelines of triangle are , then the lines are concurrent. However, it needs to be proved that the locus so defined is indeed a cubic curve. A second way is to define it as the locus of point such that if are the circumcenters of triangles , then the lines are concurrent. Yet another way is to define it as the locus of satisfying the following property known as the quadrangles involutifs (this was the way in which Neuberg introduced the curve): :\begin{vmatrix} 1 & BC^2+AP^2 & BC^2\times AP^2 \\\ 1 & CA^2+BP^2 & CA^2\times BP^2\\\ 1 & AB^2+CP^2& AB^2\times CP^2 \end{vmatrix} = 0 ==Equation== Let be the side lengths of the reference triangle . Then the equation of the Neuberg cubic of in barycentric coordinates is : \sum_{\text{cyclic}} [a^2(b^2+c^2)- (b^2-c^2)^2 -2a^4]x(c^2y^2 - b^2z^2)=0 ==Other terminology: 21-point curve, 37-point curve== thumb|Neuberg cubic (21-point cubic) of triangle showing the 21-point special points on it In the older literature the Neuberg curve commonly referred to as the 21-point curve. The terminology refers to the property of the curve discovered by Neuberg himself that it passes through certain special 21 points associated with the reference triangle. Assuming that the reference triangle is , the 21 points are as listed below. *The vertices *The reflections of the vertices in the opposite sidelines *The orthocentre *The circumcenter *The three points where is the reflection of A in the line joining and where is the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of with and is the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of with ; and are defined similarly *The six vertices of the equilateral triangles constructed on the sides of triangle *The two isogonic centers (the points X(13) and X(14) in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers) *The two isodynamic points (the points X(15) and X(16) in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers) The attached figure shows the Neuberg cubic of triangle with all the above mentioned 21 special points on it. In a paper published in 1925, B. H. Brown reported his discovery of 16 additional special points on the Neuberg cubic making the total number of then known special points on the cubic 37. Because of this, the Neuberg cubic is also sometimes referred to as the 37-point cubic. Currently, a huge number of special points are known to lie on the Neuberg cubic. Gilbert's Catalogue has a special page dedicated to a listing of such special points which are also triangle centers. ==Some properties of the Neuberg cubic== ===Neuberg cubic as a circular cubic=== The equation in trilinear coordinates of the line at infinity in the plane of the reference triangle is :ax+by+cz=0 There are two special points on this line called the circular points at infinity. Every circle in the plane of the triangle passes through these two points and every conic which passes through these points is a circle. The trilinear coordinates of these points are :\begin{align} & \cos B + i\sin B : \cos A - i\sin A : -1 \\\ & \cos B-i\sin B : \cos A+i\sin A: -1 \end{align} where i=\sqrt{-1}. Any cubic curve which passes through the two circular points at infinity is called a circular cubic. The Neuberg cubic is a circular cubic. ===Neuberg cubic as a pivotal isogonal cubic=== The isogonal conjugate of a point with respect to a triangle is the point of concurrence of the reflections of the lines about the angle bisectors of respectively. The isogonal conjugate of is sometimes denoted by . The isogonal conjugate of is . A self-isogonal cubic is a triangle cubic that is invariant under isogonal conjugation. A pivotal isogonal cubic is a cubic in which points lying on the cubic and their isogonal conjugates are collinear with a fixed point known as the pivot point of the cubic. The Neuberg cubic is a pivotal isogonal cubic having its pivot at the intersection of the Euler line with the line at infinity. In Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers, this point is denoted by X(30). ===Neuberg cubic as a pivotol orthocubic=== Let be a point in the plane of triangle . The perpendicular lines at to intersect respectively at and these points lie on a line . Let the trilinear pole of be . An isopivotal cubic is a triangle cubic having the property that there is a fixed point such that, for any point M on the cubic, the points are collinear. The fixed point is called the orthopivot of the cubic. The Neuberg cubic is an orthopivotal cubic with orthopivot at the triangle's circumcenter. ==Additional reading== * * *Abdikadir Altintas, On Some Properties Of Neuberg Cubic * ==References== Category:Triangle geometry
