"Never Be the Same" is a song by American singer Camila Cabello from her debut studio album, Camila (2018). It was digitally released as a single on December 7, 2017, and sent to US contemporary hit radio on January 9, 2018. Cabello gave her first televised performance of the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in January 2018. In the US, "Never Be the Same" peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified four-times platinum. It peaked at number 1 in Flanders and Croatia as well as in the top 10 in thirteen additional countries. The music video was directed by Los Angeles-based director Grant Singer and released on March 8, 2018. The duet version of the song, featuring singer Kane Brown, was released on April 27, 2018. The song was written by Cabello, Noonie Bao, Sasha Sloan, and its producer Frank Dukes, and co-producers Jarami. "Never Be the Same" received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its drum hook. ==Background== Cabello first performed the song during the B96 Summer Bash '17 on June 24, 2017. It was later included on the set list of her opening act for Bruno Mars' 24K Magic World Tour, firstly titled "I'll Never Be the Same" back then. Cabello wrote the lyrics of the song, inspired by a relationship she had a couple years back. The album includes two versions of the song. The original contains the line, "Nicotine, heroin, morphine" which is substituted in the radio edit version: "Nicotine, rushing me, touching me". On the week of the album release, Billboard reported that, Cabello revealed in a recent interview that she wants to rework one of her songs into a country song with a country singer. Says Joey Arbagey, executive VP of A&R; of Epic Records, Sam Hunt was being considered then, but Cabello later chose Kane Brown and it worked out perfectly. This song has received plenty of praises from many country and pop/rock singers since it was out, including Brown, Keith Urban, Kelsea Ballerini, James Barker from James Barker Band, Demi Lovato, Ellie Rowsell from Wolf Alice and more. Urban and Ballerini also covered the song on Urban's Graffiti U World Tour. Cabello tweeted about her excitement for the cover song along with a clip of the performance. ==Composition and lyrics== "Never Be the Same" has been described as a power pop, electro, dark pop ballad. The upbeat track features Cabello singing falsetto in the pre-chorus. According to sheet music published by Sony/ATV Music Publishing on Musicnotes.com, "Never Be the Same" is composed in the key of C Major and set in common time at a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute. Cabello's voice ranges from a low of D3 to a high of G5, and the music has a C-G-Dm-F chord progression. The song features booming drums and echoed effects, mimicking Hal Blaine's opening drum phrase from The Ronettes' 1963 song "Be My Baby." The song's lyrics incorporate themes of a pain-is-pleasure type of love. They were described by Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph as "a melodrama about addictive love". ==Critical reception== Newsdays Glenn Gamboa wrote in his album review, "Cabello is at her peak on ["Never Be the Same"] which shows off what sets her apart from the pop pack. [...] That she can quickly switch to her full voice for the desperate chorus is the mark of a star." In Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield considered that Cabello "really hits her stride in "Never Be the Same," which sounds like Brian Eno's alien-prog masterwork Another Green World souped up into sputtering glitz-pop [...] It's [Cabello] at her best – even at her most tormented, she sounds totally confident and totally herself." In an unfavorable review, Patrick Ryan of USA Today felt the song was "overproduced" with "frequently indecipherable lyrics". Rolling Stone listed it 4th of "50 Best Songs of 2018", "After the slow-burning piano grind of 'Havana', Camila switches gears for a gigantic electro ballad that proves this girl can handle any kind of song. In 'Never Be The Same', she's an infatuation junkie who can't stop going back to the wrong lover, because she just can't get enough. For the big climax, Camila gasps for breath over the classic 'Be My Baby' drum hook – somewhere, Ronnie Spector must be proud." === Accolades === Year-end lists Publication List Rank Billboard The 100 Best Songs of 2018 Rolling Stone The 50 Best Songs of 2018 Uproxx The 50 Best Songs of 2018 Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield’s Top 25 Songs of 2018 Decade-end lists Publication List Rank Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield’s 50 Best Songs of 2010s Rolling Stone 100 Best Songs of the 2010s ==Commercial performance== The song entered at number 61 on the US Billboard Hot 100 as the week's top debut with 30,000 copies sold and 6.1 million streams for its first week of release.
