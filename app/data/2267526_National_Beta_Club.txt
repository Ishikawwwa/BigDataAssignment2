State conventions are held by the state sponsor and the state sponsor elect, which are elected to the position by other sponsors from the state. The state has the authority to create or deny competitions from happening in their own state. The Junior Convention hosts similar competitions except for state office. At the Senior level, there are three positions; at the Junior level, there are five. States that host state conventions: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.Convention Schedule at official website Convention Themes & Locations: # 2011–2012 ' Greensboro, North Carolina # 2012–2013 The Heart of Beta Mobile, Alabama # 2013–2014 Making History With Beta Richmond, Virginia # 2014–2015 Betas, Rockin' the country Nashville, Tennessee # 2015–2016 Let the Beta Times Roll New Orleans, Louisiana # 2016–2017 Above and Beyond Orlando, Florida # 2017–2018 Beta on My Mind Savannah, Georgia # 2018–2019 Betas Fueling the Future Oklahoma City, Oklahoma # 2019–2020 Beta As Far As You Can See Fort Worth, Texas # 2020–2021 It All Began with Beta Orlando, Florida # 2021–2022 Beta Together Nashville, Tennessee # 2022–2023 Louisville, Kentucky ==Prominent Beta alumni== *Bill Clinton, 42nd President of the United StatesNational Beta Club alumni website *Millard Fuller, Habitat for Humanity founder *Jake Delhomme, professional football athlete *Ericka Dunlap, Miss America 2004 *Heather French, Miss America 2000 *Diane Sawyer, television journalist *Herschel Walker, professional football athlete *Trisha Yearwood, country musician *Kevin Durant, professional basketball player, actor *Cam Newton, professional football player *Larriuna Shell, professional dancer *Scotty McCreery, country musician *Trevor Bayne, NASCAR driver *Justin Timberlake, American singer-songwriter *Destin Sandlin, YouTube science communicatorThe Secret Power of Your High School Year Book - Smarter Every Day 284 - YouTube ==See also== *High school club *Honor Society ==References== ==External links== * Category:Student societies in the United States Category:High school honor societies Category:Organizations established in 1934 Category:Youth organizations based in South Carolina
