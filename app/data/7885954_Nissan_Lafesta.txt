The Lafesta also replaced the Nissan Avenir. The vehicle offers sliding doors on both sides (one of which is power-assisted), Nissan's Intelligent key system, GPS navigation system, reverse camera and a very large sunroof. The only engine option available is a 2.0 L MR20DE inline-four unit. Both front- and four-wheel drive transmissions are available; the former uses a torsion beam suspension at the rear while the latter has a trailing arm multi-link arrangement.

The first generation Lafesta was discontinued in Japan on December 26, 2012, after being sold alongside the second generation, with it being rebranded as the Lafesta Joy. 2004 Nissan Lafesta (rear).jpg|Nissan Lafesta (pre-facelift) 2004-2007 NISSAN LAFESTA Highway STAR.jpg|Nissan Lafesta Highway Star (pre-facelift) Lafesta07.jpg|Nissan Lafesta (facelift) Lafesta07rear.jpg|Nissan Lafesta (facelift) Nissan Lafesta.jpg|Nissan Lafesta Highway Star (facelift) Nissan Lafesta 001.JPG|Interior == Second generation (B35; 2011) == thumb|left|Rear view The second generation Lafesta is a version of the third generation Mazda Premacy supplied to Nissan by Mazda on an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) basis.
