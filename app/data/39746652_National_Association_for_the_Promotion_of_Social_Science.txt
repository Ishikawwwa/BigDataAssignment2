The National Association for the Promotion of Social Science (NAPSS), often known as the Social Science Association, was a British reformist group founded in 1857 by Lord Brougham. It pursued issues in public health, industrial relations, penal reform, and female education. It was dissolved in 1886. ==Background== The efforts of George Hastings brought together three groups of the 1850s to form the NAPSS: the Society for Promoting the Amendment of the Law, the National Reformatory Union, and the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women (the Langham Place Group). It took as model the British Association for the Advancement of Science, holding an itinerant annual meeting, which provided a forum for social reformers. The objective of the Association was defined as "to coordinate the efforts of the experts and the politicians". One factor in the eventual decline of the NSPSS was that the objectives of medical reformers changed. Legislation and the efforts of central government to improve public health became less important to them. Its first secretary was Isa Knox. ==Congresses== Twenty-eight Social Science Congresses took place: Year Location President 1857 Birmingham Lord Brougham 1858 Liverpool Lord John Russell 1859 Bradford Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury 1860 Glasgow Lord Brougham 1861 Dublin Lord Brougham 1862 London Lord Brougham 1863 Edinburgh Lord Brougham 1864 York Lord Brougham 1865 Sheffield Lord Brougham 1866 Manchester Earl of Shaftesbury 1867 Belfast Lord Dufferin and Clandeboye 1868 Birmingham Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon 1869 Bristol Sir Stafford Northcote 1870 Newcastle Algernon Percy, 6th Duke of Northumberland 1871 Leeds Sir John Pakington 1872 Plymouth Francis Napier, 10th Lord Napier 1873 Norwich Lord Houghton 1874 Glasgow Lord Rosebery 1875 Brighton Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare 1876 Liverpool Charles Gordon, 11th Marquess of Huntly 1877 Aberdeen Earl of Aberdeen 1878 Cheltenham Charles Bowyer Adderley, 1st Baron Norton 1879 Manchester James Fraser 1880 Edinburgh Lord Reay 1881 Dublin Lord O'Hagan 1882 Nottingham George Hastings 1883 Huddersfield Sir Richard Temple 1884 Birmingham George Shaw-Lefevre 1885 No meeting N/a ==Committees== ===Trades Societies and Strikes=== A committee of the Association produced Report on Trade Societies and Strikes (1860). This report was highly regarded: Sidney and Beatrice Webb later called it "the best collection of Trade Union material and the most impartial account of Trade Union action that has ever been issued". There were contributions by three Christian Socialists (Thomas Hughes, John Malcolm Forbes Ludlow, and F. D. Maurice). Hughes was one of two secretaries to the committee (with P. M. Rathbone). The committee included the Liberal politicians William Edward Forster, and Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, 1st Baronet. There was one trade unionist as member, Thomas Joseph Dunning. ===Quarantine Committee=== The Association's Quarantine Committee was set up in 1858. Its report was published officially by Parliament. ==Notes== Category:Defunct organisations based in England Category:Social sciences organizations Category:Organizations established in 1857 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1886 Category:1857 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1886 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Learned societies of the United Kingdom Category:Medical and health organisations based in the United Kingdom
