NOVA Pro Wrestling (often referred to as simply NOVA Pro) is an American professional wrestling promotion that was established in 2015 based in Northern Virginia. The company's name comes from the abbreviation of its location, Northern Virginia ("NoVa"). The promotion was founded by Mike King Jr., and his son, Mike E. King, with the intention to showcase the top independent wrestlers of Virginia, Maryland, and the general Mid-Atlantic region, as well as bring some of independent wrestling's popular names to the Northern Virginia area. The debut show, titled "The NOVA Project", took place on September 25, 2015 in Fairfax, Virginia. == History == NOVA Pro Wrestling began on Friday, September 25, 2015, with its first show, "The NOVA Project", taking place at the Jewish Community Center of Northern Virginia, in Fairfax. The event was presented by the Virginia promotion Ground Xero Wrestling (GXW), and was run using their promoter's license and much of their equipment. The first show, casually referred to as a pilot episode, was considered a borderline success, despite several last minute changes to the card. This was primarily due to issues related to Virginia's licensing committee, as the show took place with only one of the originally advertised matches taking place as planned. NOVA Pro waited until the new year to run again, this time with their own promoter's license. The first show of 2016, titled "Stay Vicious", ran on Sunday, January 31, 2016, from the Annandale Sports Center in Springfield, Virginia. The promotion would continue to run, both in Springfield and Fairfax, every other month until July, when the frequency increased to monthly shows, as the crowds continued to grow. The company celebrated their one-year anniversary with "The NOVA Project 2" on September 16, 2016, which featured the first steel cage match in the promotion's history, capping off a year-long feud between Sonjay Dutt and Logan Easton Laroux. The last show of the calendar year took place on Black Friday, November 25, 2016, and featured one of the last independent wrestling appearances of Chris Hero before his second stint with the WWE. 2017 began for NOVA Pro Wrestling, with "RELoad" on Friday, February 17, 2017 drawing one of its biggest crowds at a brand new venue, the Annandale Volunteer Fire Department in Annandale, Virginia. This location would split time with the original Fairfax location for the year, with NOVA's return to Fairfax hosting the first ever Commonwealth Cup on Friday, April 14, 2017. The one-night, 12-man tournament was won by Logan Easton Laroux, and was made even more significant by his win in the finals over Arik Royal, who had previously been undefeated in NOVA Pro since its inception in 2015. 2017 continued to be a year of firsts for NOVA Pro, as the company slowly discovered its identity. June 10, 2017 featured the first ever tryout show, "Life Is Like A Box of Chocolates", with a full NOVA Pro show, "Hi Fidelity", later that evening as well. The show "American Slang '17", on July 14, was main evented by NOVA's first ever ladder match, between PWI Ultra J Champion Chet Sterling and Logan Easton Laroux. "Cool for the Summer", on August 18, 2017, marked the company's first ever sold-out crowd, and was headlined by a No Disqualification intergender match between Angelus Layne and Keith Lee. This match came about as the focal point of a feud between Layne and promoter Mike E. King, after Layne threw a fireball at the promoter's face one month earlier. Lee was brought in to face Layne in the first intergender main event, though not the first or only instance of intergender wrestling in the promotion's history. Friday, September 22, 2017 marked a second consecutive sell-out crowd, this time in the larger Fairfax venue, for "The NOVA Project 3". As the promotion entered its third year of operation, it enjoyed significant growth in exposure thanks to features in The Washington Post and Washington City Paper, as well as many national outlets, in part thanks to appearances from viral sensation "The Progressive Liberal" Daniel Richards. Around this time, the promotion signed with streaming service Powerbomb.TV to make past shows available on the site, and announce their first live-streamed show on Thursday, December 28, 2017, main evented by Powerbomb TV Independent Champion Jonathan Gresham defending against Sonjay Dutt. Since then, NOVA has announced that they will continue to make shows available on the service, as well as produce more live streamed shows in 2018. In June, NOVA Pro produced both a men's and women's Commonwealth Cup, although the early rounds of the Women's Cup were not available live as the show was a matinee. In addition, in September, it was announced that NOVA Pro would do a show outside Virginia for the first time as the company would perform as part of WrestleMania 35 weekend. == Events == === 2015 === Event Date Venue Location Main event Ref.

The relationship with PWI lasted for two years, and included title defenses of the Ultra J Championship. On January 7, 2018, in a tweet from the official account, NOVA Pro announced that they were no longer a member of Pro Wrestling International. In August 2017, NOVA Pro announced that they had linked up with the streaming service Powerbomb TV, with a staggered rollout of the entire library of shows. On September 6, 2017, “The NOVA Project” marked NOVA Pro Wrestling's debut to the streaming service. Later that month, it was announced that the show “Such Great Heights” on December 28, 2017 would be the first ever live streamed event in the promotion's history. NOVA Pro has announced that they will continue to stream live on Powerbomb TV going forward. == Roster == === Male roster === * Arik Royal * Beau Crockett * Bobby Shields * Breaux Keller * Brian Johnston * Cabana Man Dan * Coach Gator (Manager) * Coach Mikey (Manager) * David Stark * David Starr * Devin Cutter * Dominic Garrini * Fred Yehi * Graham Bell * Gunner Miller * Innocent Isaiah * Isaiah Frazier * Jake Garvin * Jake Hollister * Jaxon Stone * Jay Sin * John Kermon * John Skyler * Jonathan Gresham * Josh Fuller * Kerry Awful * Kevin Ku * Lance Lude * Logan Easton Laroux * Lucas Calhoun * Mack Buckler * Mason Cutter * Matthew May * Mikey Banker * Money Greene * Nick Gage * Nick Iggy * Paul Jordane * Rob Killjoy * Sage Philips * Satu Jinn * Sonjay Dutt * Teddy King * Tim Donst * Tracy Williams * Tripp Cassidy * Victor Benjamin * Wheeler YUTA ==== Tag teams & stables ==== * Capital Vices (Jay Sin & Money Greene) * The Carnies (Nick Iggy, Kerry Awful, & Tripp Cassidy) * Fuller's House (Josh Fuller & Mack Buckler) * Sadkampf (Dominic Garrini & Kevin Ku) * The Gator Pit (Brian Johnson, Mikey Banker, Jake Garvin, & Satu Jinn, managed by Coach Gator) * The Hooligans (Devin Cutter & Mason Cutter) * The Main Attraction (Beau Crockett, Jake Hollister, Paul Jordane, & Teddy King) * The Ugly Ducklings (Lance Lude & Rob Killjoy, managed by Coach Mikey) === Female roster === * Allie Kat * Aspyn Rose * Barbi Hayden * Brittany Blake * Faye Jackson * Harlow O’Hara * Jordan Blade * Jordynne Grace * Lady Frost (manager) * Laynie Luck * LuFisto * Penelope Ford * Sahara Se7en * Shazza McKenzie * Terra Calaway * Veda Scott === Staff and personnel === * Todd Myers - Referee * Chris Sharpe - Referee * Bill Olsen - Referee * Kevin Burr - Referee * Andrew McHale - Referee * Jason Heat - Play by Play Commentator * Emil Jay - Color Commentator * Lolo McGrath - Ring Announcer === Notable guests and alumni === * The Barbarian * Bravado Brothers * Cedric Alexander * Chase Owens * Chris Hero * Chuck Taylor * Detective Dan Barry * "The Progressive Liberal" Daniel Richards * DJZ * Donovan Dijak * Jimmy Jacobs * Joey Janela * Keith Lee * Kimber Lee * Mia Yim * Matt Cross * Matt Tremont * Rachael Ellering * Rickey Shane Page * Shane Strickland * Tony Atlas * Trevor Lee == Championships == At present time, NOVA Pro Wrestling does not have any recognized championships. === Other accomplishments === Accomplishment Latest winner(s) Date won Location Men's Commonwealth Cup Wheeler YUTA Annandale, Virginia Women's Commonwealth Cup Jordynne Grace Annandale, Virginia Old Dominion Rumble Arik Royal Fairfax, Virginia == See also == *List of independent wrestling promotions in the United States *Independent wrestling == References == == External links == * * Twitter * Facebook Category:Professional wrestling in Virginia Category:Entertainment companies established in 2015 Category:Independent professional wrestling promotions based on the East Coast of the United States Category:Companies based in Virginia Category:2015 establishments in Virginia
