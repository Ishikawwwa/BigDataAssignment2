North Camp railway station is situated in the civil parish of Ash in Surrey, England. It takes its name from the nearby North Camp area of Farnborough, Hampshire. The station is managed by Great Western Railway, who provide services on the North Downs Line from Reading to Guildford, Redhill and Gatwick Airport. It is staffed on a part-time basis (mornings/early afternoons, Mon-Sat) and has a level crossing at the Reading end. ==Ash Vale== The station is less than half a mile (one kilometre)'s walk from Ash Vale station (on the Ascot to Guildford line).
