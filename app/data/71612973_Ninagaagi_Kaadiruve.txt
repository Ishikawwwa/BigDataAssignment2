S. Umesh * Suresh Mangalore * Mohan Juneja * Bank Suresh * Dr Vijaykumar * Rakesh Lobo ==Music== == Reception == === Critical response === R G Vijayasarathy of Rediff.com scored the film at 1.5 out of 5 stars and says "Pooja Gandhi looks glamorous in the song sequences, but her performance is average. Vishal Hegde is the pick of the lot. Dileep scores in the villain's role though it is not well defined. The Bahumaanavaadhe song is well composed by Robin Gurang. Camera work is just passable. All in all, Ninagaagi Kaadiruve is a big yawn. Watch it only if you do not have any other alternative". A critic from Deccan Herald wrote "Touted a suspense-thriller-cum-love story, ‘Ninagagi...’ preys on viewers’ nerves. Coming just a week after ‘Huchchi’, Pooja’s nervous pants and shrieks do not register, damaging the nearly non- existent storyline. She should also be taught the nuances of diction. Another mystery is why an actor like Dileep Raj chose such a role. Jolly Bastian has taken everyone for a jolly ride with this one". A critic from Bangalore Mirror wrote "Though it is commendable that Pooja Gandhi is dubbing for her roles, her accent adds to the snickering moments for the audience. Ninagaagi Kaadiruve is not a bad film and is worth a watch but it could have been much better". ==References== Category:2000s Kannada-language films Category:2009 films
