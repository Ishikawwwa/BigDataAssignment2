The Fraternal Order of Police sued, claiming that the number of signatures on the petition was too low. However, the Davidson County Election Commission voted on August 15, 2018, to add it to the November 2018 ballot. The Metro Council received more than 150 nominations for membership, and the Council's January 22, 2019, meeting to appoint members lasted 5 hours. === General Assembly pushback === During the opening weeks of the 111th Tennessee General Assembly, many Republican leaders began openly debating limiting the powers of the Board. On February 4, 2019, Representative Michael Curcio (R-Dickson), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced he would be introducing legislation to eliminate the diversity requirements of the board, including any requirements based on employment history, economic status, or demographics. It would also revoke the board's subpoena power. This legislation would apply to any community oversight board in the state, not just Nashville's. == References == == Further reading == * * == External links == * * Community Oversight Now - an advocacy organization * Community Oversight Nashville - a coalition of advocacy groups * Category:Organizations based in Nashville, Tennessee Category:Police oversight organizations Category:Government watchdog groups in the United States Category:Law enforcement in Tennessee Category:Liberal organizations
