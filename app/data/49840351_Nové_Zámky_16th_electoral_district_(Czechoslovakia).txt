The Nové Zámky 16th electoral district ('XVI. Nové Zámky') was a parliamentary constituency in the First Czechoslovak Republic for elections to the Chamber of Deputies. The seat of the District Electoral Commission was in the town of Nové Zámky. The constituency elected 11 members of the Chamber of Deputies. ==Demographics== The boundaries of the Nové Zámky 16th electoral district and the Kosice 20th electoral district had been drawn to maximize the number of Hungarian and German voters in these districts. 96% of all Hungarians and 59% of all Germans in Slovakia lived in these two electoral districts. In Nové Zámky 16th electoral district 36% of the inhabitants were ethnic Czechoslovaks. The 1921 Czechoslovak census estimated that the Nové Zámky 16th electoral district had 629,458 inhabitants. Thus there was one Chamber of Deputies member for each 57,223 inhabitants, far more than the national average of 45,319 inhabitants per seat. The Košice 20th electoral district had 57,238 inhabitants per seat. Only the Užhorod 23rd electoral district (i.e. Subcarpathian Rus') had a higher amount of inhabitants per seat that the Nové Zámky and Košice districts in all of Czechoslovakia. As of the 1930 census Nove Zámky 16th electoral district had the second-highest number of inhabitants per seat (64,273/seat), after Užhorod. ==Senate elections== In election to the Senate Nové Zamky 16th electoral district and Košice 20th electoral district together formed the Nové Zámky 9th senatorial electoral district (which elected 9 senators), in spite of the fact that the two electoral districts were geographically separated. ==1920 election== In the 1920 Czechoslovak parliamentary election the majority of votes in Nové Zámky were cast for social democrats and the Hungarian-German Social Democratic Party emerged as the largest party. With 35.7% of the votes it got 4 deputies elected (Paul Wittich, Samuel Mayer, Gyula Nagy and Jozsef Földessy). Also in the fray was the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers Party which obtained 15.3% of the vote and got a deputy elected (Ivan Dérer). The social democrats mobilized voters both in industrial centres (like Bratislava) as well as amongst agricultural labourers in the country-side. The second largest party in the district was the Hungarian-German Christian Social Party, which polled 24.5% of the votes.Duin, P.C. van. Central European Cross- roads: Social Democracy and National Revolution in Bratislava (Pressburg), 1867-1921 János Tobler and Johann Jabloniczky were two of their deputies. ==1929 election== Party Party Votes % Provincial Christian-Socialist Party 119,987 37.64 Communist Party of Czechoslovakia 53,702 16.84 Republican Party of Agrarian and Smallholding Peoples 33,687 10.57 Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers Party 31,093 9.75 Hlinka's Slovak People's Party 29,475 9.25 Czechoslovak National Socialist Party 12,140 3.81 Czechoslovak Traders' Party 8,569 2.69 United Jewish and Polish Parties 7,480 2.35 Provincial Party of Smallholders, Entrepreneurs and Workers 5,733 1.80 German Electoral Coalition 4,268 1.34 Czechoslovak National Democracy 4,002 1.26 German Social Democratic Workers Party 3,813 1.20 Czechoslovak People's Party 2,065 0.65 Juriga's Slovak People's Party 1,952 0.61 League Against Bound Tickets 843 0.26 Total Total 318,809 100 The percentage achieved by the Communist Party in the district was the highest in the country in the 1929 vote.Manuel Statistique de la Republique Tchecoslovaque.
