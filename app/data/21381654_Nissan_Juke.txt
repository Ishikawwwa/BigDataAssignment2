The is a subcompact crossover SUV (B-segment) produced by the Japanese car manufacturer Nissan since 2010. Debuted as a production vehicle at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show in March and positioned below the C-segment Qashqai, it was introduced to North America at the 2010 New York International Auto Show to be sold for the 2011 model year. The second-generation model was revealed for the European market in September 2019, offering larger dimensions by utilising the newer Renault–Nissan CMF-B platform. The second generation marks the withdrawal of the model from most markets outside Europe and Australasia to make way for the Nissan Kicks. The name "juke" means to "dance or change directions demonstrating agility", and is also derived from the word "jukebox". __TOC__ == First generation (F15; 2010) == On 11 February 2009, Nissan announced that the model would go into production at the Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK (NMUK) plant in Sunderland, United Kingdom, during 2010 following its appearance as the Nissan Qazana concept car at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show. File:NISSAN QAZANA.jpg|Nissan Qazana (front view) File:NISSAN QAZANA rear.jpg|Nissan Qazana (rear view) The Juke was designed at Nissan Design Europe in London and refined at Nissan's Design Centre in Japan. It is based on the Nissan B platform. The Sunderland plant (NMUK) manufactures for the European market, Australia and New Zealand, while Nissan's facility in Oppama, Japan, produces the vehicle for all other countries. Both Sunderland and Oppama are suppliers of the all-wheel drive variant. The Purwakarta plant (NMI) in Indonesia assembled the Juke for the domestic market and Thailand with a local content of 40 percent, front-wheel-drive only. A rebadged version of the first-generation Juke was sold in China as the Infiniti ESQ. === Design === The car's profile is dominated by the prominent wheel arches and the body's high waistline which contrast with the slim side windows, which is a modern interpretation of "coke bottle styling" popular during the 1960s and 1970s. Echoing a style first seen Nissan's high performance electric coupé concept shown at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show, the glasshouse resembles a racing helmet visor. A coupé-like appearance is achieved by the rear door handles being located near the C-pillars, within the window frame. Locating the rear door handles within the window frame is a Nissan styling tradition, begun with the 1985 Nissan Pathfinder. The sport motif continues inside with the red or grey-painted centre console bearing similarity to a motorcycle fuel tank. The front end features a stacked array of lights. Running lamps and indicators are mounted atop the front wings, their lenses visible from inside the cabin as an aid to maneuvering. Below them, under the lower edges of an expansive, curved grille, the main headlamps are intended to be reminiscent of those fitted to rally cars during the 1960s and 1970s. Where fitted, fog lamps are situated on a third level within the sump guard at the bottom.

The rear seats have a 60/40 split and can be folded down independently in order to carry larger objects. The rear cargo area is small but features additional storage beneath the floor (front wheel drive models only). The steering column instrumentation cluster features a tachometer, speedometer, and a small display between them that displays real-time fuel efficiency, odometer and trip odometer. The center portion of the dash contains the radio and the I-CON control (if equipped). Depending on market and trim level the Juke may be equipped with iPod or USB connectivity, NissanConnect GPS navigation, rear-view camera and Bluetooth audio. A relatively deep glovebox on the passenger side houses an iPod connector (if equipped). All but base models are equipped with Nissan's Integrated Control System, dubbed I-CON: a command module that sits in the lower dashboard, which manages both the climate control and the vehicle's drive mode (Normal, Sport or Eco). Its display and nomenclature change according to the function selected. Among the available display data are fuel efficiency stats, real-time G-force measurements and turbo boost pressure. === Markets === ==== Japan ==== In Japan, where the car was launched on 9 June 2010, orders totalled 10,943 units in its first month, surpassing Nissan's monthly target of 1,300.

On 12 February 2015, Nissan Motor Indonesia added "Revolt" trim to the lineup, while introducing facelift for Indonesian Juke. Between 2014 and 2017, the locally assembled Juke was exported to Thailand. Production ceased in September 2018. ==== Chile ==== Sales began in 2012 for the Juke identical to the UK model sold in Chile.

The engine is upgraded to at 6,300 rpm and at 3,600 rpm. The New York Times review was generally positive, but: "About that styling: I love it, but you might hate it. The face is dominated by bug- eye headlamps, and the running lights bulge up above the hood such that they’re in the driver’s line of sight. At night, the effect is of large bio- luminescent slugs lounging atop the front fenders. Admittedly, it’s more appealing than I’m making it sound.""Lord Zog, Your Ride Is Ready", NY Times, 02/08/2014 File:Nissan Juke 1.6 DIG-T Nismo – Frontansicht, 15.
