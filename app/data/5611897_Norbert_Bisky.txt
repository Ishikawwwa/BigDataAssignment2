Comparing the belief in communism to a religion, he processed his childhood memories by painting "those images of paradise" and "false promises" into dazzling bright images of idealized bodies and untouched nature.Norbert Bisky in an interview with Karen Wright, in: Modern Painters, March 2005, pp. 76-81. In later years, Bisky's large-size paintings, often depicting adolescents, increasingly shifted towards darker themes. Personal loss, the experience of terror, travels to Brazil and media reports inspired him to examine subjects such as violence, sexuality and destruction symbolized by figures, in many cases floating, falling or tumbling without any gravitational axis.Ein großer Maler auf dem Absturz nach oben, Article by Hans-Joachim Müller for Die Welt newspaper; published 27 April 2017; accessed 12 May 2019 Firmly established in the public conscience through media images following the September 11 attacks, these falling figures explore the transience of youth, the loss of autonomy, isolation and the disintegration of modern civilization. The aesthetic tumult surrounding the figures is punctuated by the cross pollination of cues from Christian ideology, art history, gay culture, pornography and apocalyptic visions.Angriff mit Farbe, Article by Elisa von Hof for Berliner Morgenpost newspaper; published 9 September 2017; accessed 12 May 2019 Through this, Bisky transmits an impression of instability on the canvas that distinctly resonates with our contemporary state of affairs.https://artmap.com/koenigandclinton/exhibition/norbert-bisky-2007 Exhibition text for "What's Wrong With Me?" at Leo Koenig Inc., New York, 2007 In May 2013, Norbert Bisky created his first stage set for the piece "Masse" by the Berlin State Ballet that premiered in the legendary Berlin Nightclub Berghain in May 2013 and was the subject of a TV documentary by German director Nicole Graf.Website of Ballet Journal Since May 2017 Norbert Bisky's large-format painting "Vertigo" is prominently displayed in Berghain's entrance hall as part of the club's art concept, which also features works by Wolfgang Tillmans and Joseph Marr.Want to See Norbert Bisky's New Paintings?
