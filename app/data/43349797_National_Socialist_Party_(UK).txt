The National Socialist Party was a small political party in the United Kingdom, founded in 1916. It originated as a minority group within the British Socialist Party who supported British participation in World War I; while historically linked with the Marxist left, the party broke with internationalism. It affiliated to the Labour Party and was eventually absorbed by it. ==Origins== The National Socialist Party was founded by H.M. Hyndman and his followers after his defeat in the leadership elections of the British Socialist Party. They believed that it was desirable to support the United Kingdom in World War I against "Prussian militarism". Although maintaining that they were a Marxist party, after affiliation to the Labour Party in 1918, they renounced vanguardism and saw in the Russian Revolution only the danger that it might weaken the United Kingdom's war effort. The party was grouped around the newspaper Justice. Three members of the party were elected to Parliament in the 1918 election; Dan Irving and Will Thorne were elected for the Labour Party, and Jack Jones under the National Socialist Party name.Max Beer, A History of British Socialism ==Social Democratic Federation== In 1919, the group changed its name to the Social Democratic Federation, reverting to the name that the British Socialist Party had used. At one point eleven MPs were members, but after Hyndman died in 1921, the group gradually dissolved into the Labour Party.Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations The party sponsored several candidates at each election until 1924, all of whom ran for Labour. After 1924, its MPs were instead sponsored by their local Labour Party. The party finally disbanded in 1939 due to a lack of funds, although some remaining members formed a "Social Democratic Fellowship"."End of the S.D.F.", Manchester Guardian, 2 November 1939, p.3 Other prominent members included Henry W. Lee, Hunter Watts, John Stokes and Joseph Burgess. ==Election results== Election Seats won Â± Total votes % Position Leader 1918 11,013 (#12) 0.1% Henry Hyndman ===1918 UK general election=== Constituency Candidate Votes Percentage PositionMartin Crick, The History of the Social- Democratic Federation, p.332 Burnley 15,217 41.9 1 Reading 1,462 5.2 4 Romford 2,580 14.4 3 Silvertown 6,971 51.6 1 ===By-elections, 1918-1922=== Election Candidate Votes Percentage Position 1921 Kirkcaldy Burghs by-election 11,674 53.4 1 ===1922 UK general election=== Constituency Candidate Votes Percentage Position Burnley 17,385 39.1 1 Kirkcaldy Burghs 12,089 48.6 2 ===1923 UK general election=== Constituency Candidate Votes Percentage Position Buckingham 11,824 47.0 2 Burnley 16,848 37.8 1 Islington South 7,764 37.0 1 Islington West 7,955 41.4 1 Kirkcaldy Burghs 14,221 54.4 1 ===1924 UK general election=== Election Candidate Votes Percentage Position Buckingham 8,939 30.6 2 Islington South 10,347 42.8 1 Islington West 10,174 45.3 1 Kirkcaldy Burghs 14,038 52.7 1 ==References== Category:Defunct social democratic parties in the United Kingdom Category:Political parties established in 1916 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1941 Category:Organisations associated with the Labour Party (UK) Category:History of the Labour Party (UK) Category:1916 establishments in the United Kingdom
