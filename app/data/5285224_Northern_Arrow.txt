Northern Arrow was one of the named passenger trains of the Pennsylvania Railroad, starting at Cincinnati, Ohio and ending at Mackinaw City, Michigan. It had merging branches originating from Chicago, Illinois, converging in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and a train from St. Louis, Missouri from the west, converging at Richmond, Indiana.Maiken, Peter. Night Trains, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989, p. 351, drawing from a 1952 Official Guide to the Railways issue . Carrying the number #519 northbound and #520 southbound, it used the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, a leased subsidiary of the Pennsylvania system. The train was frequented by northbound travelers to popular Northern Michigan resort destinations north of Grand Rapids, Michigan, such as Petoskey, Bay View (only northbound trains stopped there; it was the stop after Petoskey), Mackinaw City and Mackinac Island. One section of the Northern Arrow was a seasonal summer-only weekly service between Chicago and Mackinaw City.Pennsylvania timetable, August 6, 1950, Tables 22, 23 http://streamlinermemories.info/PRR/PRR50TT.pdf Additional northbound sleeper sections after leaving Petoskey diverged west to Harbor Springs.Maiken, Peter. Night Trains, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989, p. 71, p. 351, drawing from a 1952 Official Guide to the Railways issue . The Northern Arrow ran express from Grand Rapids to Cadillac (albeit, available for flagstops and Reed City). The PRR ran a local counterpart from Grand Rapids to Mackinaw City (later cut back to Petoskey)Pennsylvania Railroad timetable, August 6, 1950, Table 22 http://streamlinermemories.info/PRR/PRR50TT.pdf which served the bypassed stations. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway operated the Resort Special that served the Chicago to Petoskey market. For the Grand Rapids to Petoskey route, the Resort Special was a competitor with the Northern Arrow. During World War II and immediately after, 1942â€“1946, the Northern Arrow was one of the named trains dropped from service.Pennsylvania Railroad timetable, March 1946, Table 32 http://streamlinermemories.info/PRR/PRR46TT.pdf On May 26, 1950, the Northern Arrow was re-equipped with a lightweight lounge and sleeping cars plus a dining car decorated with Northern Michigan photomurals. It did not operate outside of the summer months, as there were no trains on the route north of Grand Rapids during the colder months.Pennsylvania Railroad timetable, January 18, 1954, Table 30 http://streamlinermemories.info/PRR/PRR54-1TT.pdf The PRR ended its local counterpart service between 1954 and 1955. Northern Arrow service ended in 1961. In 1976, the Michigan Department of Transportation initiated the Michigan Northern Railway, which operated passenger service from Grand Rapids to Mackinaw City until 1986. ==References== Category:Named passenger trains of the United States Category:Passenger trains of the Pennsylvania Railroad Category:Night trains of the United States Category:Passenger rail transportation in Michigan Category:Passenger rail transportation in Indiana Category:Passenger rail transportation in Ohio Category:Railway services introduced in 1935 Category:Railway services discontinued in 1961
