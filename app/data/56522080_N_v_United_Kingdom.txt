N v United Kingdom [2008] ECHR 453 is an ECHR human rights case, concerning the lawfulness of deporting an individual in the UK with serious health issues. ==Facts== A Ugandan citizen with HIV/AIDS claimed deportation to Uganda would be inhuman and degrading under ECHR article 3, because she would be unlikely to get health treatment. Without treatment she would stay alive for 2 years, with treatment for decades, almost as normal. The House of Lords [2005] UKHL 31 agreed her case was not sufficiently exceptional, to justify halting deportation. ==Judgment== The European Court of Human Rights agreed with the House of Lords that the case was not exceptional, in contrast to the case of D v United Kingdom (1997) 24 EHRR 423. ==See also== *United Kingdom enterprise law ==Notes== ==References== * Category:United Kingdom enterprise case law
