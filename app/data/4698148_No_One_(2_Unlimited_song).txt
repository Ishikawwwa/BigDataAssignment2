"No One" is a song recorded by Belgian/Dutch Eurodance band 2 Unlimited, released in September 1994 as the second single from their third album, Real Things (1994). Co-written by bandmembers Ray Slijngaard and Anita Dels, it was a top 10 hit in at least six countries, as well as on the Eurochart Hot 100, where the song reached number ten. It features a reference to "That's the Way Love Goes" by Janet Jackson and the accompanying music video, directed by La La Land, features the band performing on the beach by Great Barrier Reef in Australia. ==Critical reception== In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton commented, "What a nuisance. Here I am all set to launch an account of a new 2 Unlimited single with a witty precis of the melodic and formulaic similarity to everything else they have ever released and what happens? They go and release a track that sounds completely different to all the others! Joking aside, it is absolutely true, "No One" being the closest they will probably ever get to a conventional pop song and more deservedly a smash hit than some of their recent output. It could well end up their third Top 10 hit of the year and is now their 11th consecutive Top 20 hit." Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote, "It's their first reggae attempt, and no one has blended it with Euro dance so seamlessly before." Alan Jones from Music Week gave the song four out of five, adding that "this is a good deal slower than usual, but still relies on the he-rap, she-sing template. Likely to garner less club support but may attract some first-time supporters." In an retrospective review, Pop Rescue said it "is probably the most mellow of their singles", adding that "it definitely feels like [a] light, summer track". James Hamilton from the RM Dance Update declared it as a "rapped (mentioning Janet Jackson!), cooed and organ wheezed attractive jaunty skipper". ==Chart performance== The release scored chart success across Europe, peaking at number two in the Netherlands, number three in Belgium, number six in Finland, and number ten in both Denmark and Spain. In the United Kingdom, it was their least successful release to date, hitting number 17 in its first week at the UK Singles Chart on 25 September 1994. It also peaked at number 28 on the UK Dance Singles Chart. Additionally, the single was a top 20 hit also in Austria (14), France (19), Germany (18), Iceland (17), Ireland (18), Scotland (14), Sweden (15) and Switzerland (15). On the Eurochart Hot 100, it hit number ten, while reaching number six on MTV's European Top 20 and number two on the European Dance Radio Chart. On the Eurochart Hot 100 year-end chart, the single ended up as number 64. Outside Europe, "No One" was a sizeable top 20 hit in Israel, while in Australia, it peaked at number 70. ==Music video== The accompanying music video for "No One" was directed by La La Land. It was shot by the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and features Anita and Ray performing on the beach. Sometimes Ray also performs in a tropical forest. "No One" was later published on 2 Unlimited's official YouTube channel in 2013, and had generated more than three million views as of January 2023. ==Appearances== The melody of the song was also sampled in 1994 single by Serbian group Moby Dick with name "Kralj kokaina" ("King of Cocaine"). ==Track listings== * 7-inch single # "No One" (Radio Edit) # "No One" (Unlimited Remix Edit) * European CD maxi # "No One" (Radio Edit) – 3:27 # "No One" (Unlimited Remix- Extended) – 5:27 # "No One" (X-Out Remix) – 6:19 # "No One" (X-Out In Dub Remix) – 5:45 # "No One" (Doc Baron Mix) – 6:58 # "No One" (The It Goes Underground) – 6:36 * European 12-inch maxi # "No One" (Unlimited Rmx- Extended) – 5:27 # "No One" (Extended) – 5:24 # "No One" (X-Out Remix) – 6:19 # "No One" (X-Out In Dub Remix) – 5:45 * Italian 12-inch maxi # "No One" (Extended) – 5:24 # "No One" (X-Out Remix) – 6:19 # "No One" (Radio Edit) – 3:27 # "No One" (Unlimited Remix Extended) – 5:27 # "No One" (X-Out In Dub Remix) – 5:45 # "No One" (Unlimited Remix Edited) – 3:45 * UK CD single # "No One" (Radio Edit) – 3:29 # "No One" (Unlimited Remix) – 5:29 # "No One" (Extended) – 5:26 # "No One" (X-Out Remix) – 6:21 # "No One" (X-Out In Dub Remix) – 5:45 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1994)"No One", in various Singles Chart Lescharts.com (Retrieved 15 February 2008)German Singles Chart Charts-surfer.de (Retrieved 10 April 2008)Irish Single Chart Irishcharts.ie (Retrieved 15 February 2008)UK Singles Chart Official Charts Company (Retrieved 15 February 2008) Peak position Australia (ARIA) 70 Austria (Ö3 Austria Top 40) 14 Belgium (Ultratop Flanders) 3 Belgium (VRT Top 30 Flanders)Belgian peak 3 Denmark (IFPI) 10 Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 10 Europe (MTV European Top 20) 6 Europe (European Dance Radio) 2 Finland (Suomen virallinen lista) 6 France (SNEP) 19 Germany (Media Control Charts) 18 Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40) 17 Ireland (IRMA) 18 Israel (IBA) 18 Lithuania (M-1) 3 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 2 Netherlands (Single Top 100)"No One", in GFK Singles Chart (Retrieved 28 December 2013) 3 Scotland (OCC) 14 Spain (AFYVE) 10 Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) 15 Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) 15 UK Singles (OCC) 17 UK Dance (OCC) 28 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1994) Position Belgium (Ultratop Flanders) 29 Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 64 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 21 Netherlands (Single Top 100) 32 ==References== Category:1994 singles Category:1994 songs Category:2 Unlimited songs Category:Byte Records singles Category:English-language Dutch songs Category:Pete Waterman Entertainment singles Category:Songs about dreams Category:Songs written by Anita Doth Category:Songs written by Jean-Paul De Coster Category:Songs written by Phil Wilde Category:Songs written by Ray Slijngaard Category:ZYX Music singles
