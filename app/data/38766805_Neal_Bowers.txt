Neal Bowers (born Larry Neal Bowers, August 3, 1948 in Clarksville, Tennessee) is an American poet, novelist, memoirist, and scholar. He received the B.A. (1970) and M.A. (1971) from Austin Peay State University and the Ph.D. in English and American Literature from the University of Florida (1976). He taught for thirty-one years at Iowa State University, earning the highest academic rank awarded by the university, Distinguished Professor. His regular courses included creative writing and modern and contemporary poetry. He retired from teaching in 2008. In addition to his poetry, Bowers is best known for his defense of poetry in Words for the Taking: The Hunt for a Plagiarist (W.W. Norton, 1997). As the victim of a bizarre and relentless literary thief, Bowers made a stand for intellectual property and the deeply personal nature of the creative process at a time when fewer and fewer scholars and writers believed in either. After publishing several articles expressing his dismay, most notably University Poetry, Inc. (Poetry, July 2002), Bowers stopped writing poetry for more than a decade. Prior to that hiatus, he published hundreds of poems in such journals as Poetry, The New Yorker, Sewanee Review, Hudson Review, Shenandoah, and Virginia Quarterly Review, and his work was represented in over three dozen anthologies. ==Books== *Theodore Roethke: The Journey from I to Otherwise (biographical criticism) Univ. of Missouri Press, 1982. *The Golf Ball Diver (poetry) New Rivers Press, 1983. *James Dickey: The Poet as Pitchman (criticism) Univ. of Missouri Press, 1985. *Lost in the Heartland (poetry) Cedar Creek Press, 1990. *Night Vision (poetry) BkMk Press, 1992. *Words for the Taking: The Hunt for a Plagiarist (nonfiction) W.W.
