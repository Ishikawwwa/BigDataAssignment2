NBL1 North, formerly the Queensland Basketball League (QBL), is a semi- professional basketball league in Queensland and Northern Territory, Australia, comprising both a men's and women's competition. In 2020, Basketball Queensland partnered with the National Basketball League (NBL) to bring NBL1 to Queensland. NBL1 replaced the former QBL to create more professional pathways and opportunities for males and females playing basketball in Queensland. As a result, the QBL became the north conference of NBL1. In 2022, the league will expanded into the Northern Territory with a club from Darwin. ==History== The league was formed in 1986 as the Queensland State Basketball League. In 1994, the league merged with the South and East conferences of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) to form a North conference. 1998 saw further CBA expansion with the inclusion of a Central Conference from South Australia. The CBA was renamed the Australian Basketball Association (ABA) for the 1999 season and later added the Big V and the Waratah League for a total of six conferences. As a member of the ABA, the league took on the name of Queensland Australian Basketball League (QABL) in the early 2000s and set up a division system to separate the north and south teams within the state. The Sunstate (North Queensland) and Southern Cross (South Queensland) divisions were a big part of the league for a number of years, remaining in tacked up until the 2006 season. Following the 2006 season, the QABL restructured the competition, which saw the two divisions combining to have a statewide league of only one division for the 2007 season. In 2009, the QABL became known as the QBL following the demise of the Australian Basketball Association. In October 2019, Basketball Queensland and the National Basketball League (NBL) announced a new partnership to bring NBL1 to Queensland in 2020, with NBL1 replacing the QBL. On 15 January 2020, the QBL was officially renamed NBL1 North and became the north conference of NBL1. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 season was cancelled. For the 2022 season, the NBL1 North had a club from Darwin – the Darwin Salties – represented for the first time under the joint management of Darwin Basketball Association (DBA) and Basketball Northern Territory (BNT). It saw the NBL1 become the first Australian sport league to have clubs based in and playing out of every state and territory in Australia. ==Current clubs== Club City State Arena Joined NBL1 in NBL1 Championships Most recent Brisbane Capitals* Brisbane Queensland Auchenflower Stadium 2020 0 N/A Cairns Dolphins/Cairns Marlins* Cairns Queensland Early Settler Stadium 2020 0 N/A Darwin Salties Darwin Northern Territory Darwin Basketball Stadium 2022 0 N/A Gold Coast Rollers* Gold Coast Queensland Carrara Indoor Stadium 2020 0 N/A Ipswich Force* Ipswich Queensland Llewellyn Stadium 2020 0 N/A Logan Thunder* Logan Queensland Cornubia Park Sports Centre 2020 0 N/A Mackay Meteorettes/Mackay Meteors* Mackay Queensland Mackay Basketball Stadium 2020 0 N/A North Gold Coast Seahawks Gold Coast Queensland Runaway Bay Indoor Stadium 2022 0 N/A Northside Wizards Brisbane Queensland Northside Indoor Sports Centre 2021 0 N/A RedCity Roar Brisbane Queensland Paul Bancroft Centre 2021 0 N/A Rockhampton Cyclones/Rockhampton Rockets* Rockhampton Queensland Adani Arena Rockhampton 2020 0 N/A South West Metro Pirates* Brisbane Queensland Hibiscus Stadium 2020 0 N/A Southern Districts Spartans* Brisbane Queensland Rowland Cowan Stadium 2020 0 N/A Sunshine Coast Phoenix* Sunshine Coast Queensland Maroochydore Stadium 2020 0 N/A Townsville Flames/Townsville Heat* Townsville Queensland Townsville StarFM Stadium 2020 0 N/A USC Rip City* Sunshine Coast Queensland USC Stadium 2020 0 N/A *Teams that transferred from QBL. ==List of Champions== Team Total Titles Men's Women's Notes Titles Winning Seasons Titles Winning Seasons Brisbane Spartans/Southern Districts Spartans 17 5 1992, 1995, 1999, 2005, 2006 12 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2017, 2018, 2019 Brisbane Brewers/Brisbane Capitals 10 2 2002, 2019 8 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 2001, 2002 Won the women's inaugural title in 1986.
