Never a Dull Moment is the first solo album by then former Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, released on May 21, 2002 by MCA. ==Background== Tommy Lee began writing music in September 2000, following Methods of Mayhem's stint on Ozzfest. Lee described the process in a 2002 interview: :"I locked myself in my home and I just started writing. I didn't know what I wanted to do; it was more like [I thought] 'let's just write and see where this goes and make this like a natural progression.' What you hear is where it went. The more we started listening to it [in the studio] the more my producer started going, 'Dude, you know, you can just call this what it is.' I was like, 'What are you talking about?' And he goes, 'Why don't you just call this Tommy Lee?' After thinking about it for a while, I realized he was right. That's when I made that decision, to just go under my own name rather than a 'band' name."Worley, Gail There Are No Dull Moments Around Here: An Interview With Tommy Lee Ink19.com (2002).
