The Nissan Frontier is a nameplate used by Nissan in several regions as an alternative to the Navara and NP300 nameplates. In North America, the nameplate was used from 1997 to 2021, replacing the Hardbody. Since 2021, the Frontier sold in the US and Canada has been made a separate model distinct from the globally marketed Navara/Frontier. It is larger and developed to cater to the needs of the North American market. __TOC__ == Parallel models (D22, D40; 1997–2021) == The D22 Frontier was introduced in the US and Canada in 1997 to replace the D21 Hardbody. In other markets, the D22 Frontier is also called the Navara, NP300, Hardbody, or PickUp, among others. It was replaced by the D40 Frontier in 2004 for the 2005 model year, which was produced in the US for both the US and Canadian markets up to the 2021 model year. Both generations were mostly identical to the global version offered by Nissan elsewhere, with minor changes for the North American market. When the D23 Navara was introduced for the global market in 2014, a Nissan North America spokesperson restated that the D23 is not indicative of a D40 Frontier replacement for the North American market.
