No. 299 Squadron was a Royal Air Force squadron during the Second World War and was part of No. 38 Group. ==History== No. 299 Squadron was formed on 4 November 1943 form 'C' flight of 297 Squadron at RAF Stoney Cross, Hampshire as a special operations squadron. It became operational in April 1944 dropping SOE agents. During the Normandy landing the squadron first delivered paratroopers, and then returned to air-tow 16 Airspeed Horsa gliders across the English Channel. The squadron continued operations with resupply drops until 10 June when it returned to SOE duties. In between the SOE duties the squadron air-towed Horsa gliders for the Arnhem landing (Operation Market Garden), and the Rhine crossing (Operation Varsity). It was also involved in supply-dropping to resistance forces in Norway until the end of the war. On 7 October 1945, it lost five of its members in the crash of a Short Stirling IV in Rennes (Brittany). At the end of the Second World War the squadron disbanded at RAF Shepherds Grove, Suffolk on 15 February 1946. ==Aircraft operated== Aircraft operated by no. 299 Squadron RAF, data from From To Aircraft Version November 1943 January 1944 Lockheed Ventura Mks.I and II January 1944 February 1946 Short Stirling Mk.IV January 1945 February 1946 Short Stirling Mk.V ==Squadron bases== Bases and airfields used by no. 299 Squadron RAF, data from From To Base 4 November 1943 15 March 1944 RAF Stoney Cross, Hampshire 15 March 1944 9 October 1944 RAF Keevil, Wiltshire 9 October 1944 25 January 1945 RAF Wethersfield, Essex 25 January 1945 15 February 1946 RAF Shepherds Grove, Suffolk ==Commanding officers== Officers commanding no. 299 Squadron, data from From To Name 4 November 1943 28 December 1943 W/Cdr.
