Nextbike was a bicycle rental scheme in New Zealand, franchised from the German Nextbike company. It operated in the CBD and central suburbs of Auckland from 2008 to 2010. Due to lack of sufficient advertising revenue, the company ceased operations in that year after failing to win emergency funding from the new Auckland Council. However, it is expected to make a bid for a newly tendered contract by Council to provide a public bike rental scheme, as the bikes of the scheme are still present in storage. == History == , the bike fleet had grown from 70 to 170. The company notes that during summer, bikes were being ridden about three hours a day, which was higher than the use rate in some European schemes. To encourage use, registered riders also received 30 minutes free use each day. Unlike some much larger overseas schemes, the rental system has been implemented privately (financed by a combination of rental fees and advertising on the bikes) though it has recently won official sponsorship from the Auckland Regional Transport Authority.ARTA supports cycling Aucklanders w/ Nextbike (Press Release: ARTA, via 'scoop.co.nz', Wednesday, 7 October 2009.

The company was also involved in promoting three potential 'Great Urban Rides' routes in Auckland, aimed at marketing interesting and convenient bicycle tour routes to tourists and locals, in a city which is often considered to be unattractive to cycling. ==See also== *Cycling in Auckland *Cycling in New Zealand == References == == External links == *Nextbike Category:Community bicycle programs Category:Transport in Auckland Category:Cycling in New Zealand Category:New Zealand companies established in 2008 Category:Transport companies established in 2006 Category:Bicycle sharing in New Zealand Category:Defunct bicycle sharing
