Noel Loomis (April 3, 1905 – September 7, 1969) was a writer, principally of western, mystery and science-fiction, in the middle of the 20th century. Born and raised in the American West, he was sufficiently familiar with that territory to write a useful history of the Wells Fargo company. As an indicator of its utility, this work has been cited by well over a dozen Wikipedia pages. Access to this collection may be available through a local public library. == Personal life == Noel Loomis was born Noel Miller Loomis on April 3, 1905, in the Oklahoma Territory town of Wakita, in the Cherokee Strip, and raised in Texico, in the New Mexico Territory, and in the West Texas town of Slaton. In later life he lived in Decanso, in the San Diego, California, Back Country from 1956. He married Dorothy Moore Green, who was also a writer, in 1945. There is evidence that he had a first wife named Johnie or Jonie, who was the mother of his children.
