Notably, the film brings together current concerns over the impacts of land acquisition on local communities, and the cultural and ecological impacts wrought by land use change." Ganesh Matkari of Pune Mirror wrote "The film avoids spoon-feeding and the plot unfolds from the perspective of the operatives, as each new piece of information is revealed. This strategy works very well in the pre-interlude episodes and we easily sympathize with the protagonists' plight. The second half relies more on discussion about the problem and possible solutions. Nadi Vahate doesn't just try to use stereotypical characters, relationships or situations to make it audience-friendly but instead, it takes issues very seriously and avoids a simplistic approach or easy solutions. The ending of the film is a bit ambiguous and would not be conventionally satisfying. But that is exactly the point. Keeping things in perspective requires avoiding a good or dramatically tragic climax. Sandeep Sawant, who has also written the film and composed it masterfully, has to be credited for maintaining the tone of the film." ==Accolades == This film has won Special Jury award for the director Sandeep Sawant at 2017 Pune International Film Festival, and Special Jury Award at 2017 Zee Chitragaurav. Nadi Vahate also won "Screen National Award" at Goa Marathi Film festival. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:2010s Marathi-language films
