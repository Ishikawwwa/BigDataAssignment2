As of the 2020 Census, the population was 4,455. The city contains the second-largest population of any municipality in the county (only neighboring Derby is larger), and has the smallest geographic area. It is the second-smallest city by population in Vermont. Newport is also the name of neighboring Newport Town. Newport was founded by European Americans as a settlement in 1793 and was first called Pickerel Point. It was the place where Rogers' Rangers retreated in 1759 after a French and Indian War incursion into Canada. In the 19th century, the village was stimulated by construction of the railroad in 1863, during the American Civil War. The lumbering firm Prouty & Miller operated here from 1865. Long after the post-war Reconstruction era, the village was the site for a Reunion Society of Vermont Officers in 1891. Newport has two public schools, one private school and a branch of the Community College of Vermont. As of the 2010 census there were 4,589 people. ==History== === Early === In 1753, during the French and Indian War, an Abenaki band took English captive John Stark by canoe down Lake Memphremagog and came ashore at the site where the city of Newport later developed. Allies of the French during this war, they had captured Stark in a raid. They held him until his family and community raised a ransom. They then returned him to his home in New Hampshire. Given the warfare on the border with Canada, both sides took captives for ransom beginning in the late 17th century. Business was brisk at the time of Queen Anne and other English rulers. Newport as a settlement was founded in 1793, after the American Revolutionary War.Columbia- Lippincott Gazetteer. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1952) p. 1314 The village was first called Pickeral Point, but later renamed as Lake Bridge for its location at the head of Lake Memphremagog.Austin J. Coolidge & John B. Mansfield, A History and Description of New England; Boston, Massachusetts 1859 In 1816, part of the former town of Salem was annexed to the Town of Newport; it was absorbed into what was then a village. The railroad was constructed to Newport in 1863. In 1868, the Lake Bridge settlement was incorporated as the Village of Newport. It became a busy lumber town. The lumbering firm of Prouty & Miller was started in 1865.Vermont Almanac accessed March 2, 2008 In 1932, during the Great Depression, the city operated a poor farm for the indigent, who worked for their board. === Transportation === The Lady of the Lake steam excursion/ferry boat started operating in 1867. It stopped operations in 1917. This steamboat is used as Newport's logo. In 1868, a livery stable started operating behind a hotel, several blocks from the railway station, which opened in 1863. At its peak, its owner kept 100 horses there. By the late 19th century, the Boston & Maine and Central Vermont railroads were routed through Lake Bridge. The small village expanded because of increased connections to outside markets and ease of transportation; it attracted more residents. By the late 20th century, railroad passenger traffic had declined because people relied on individual vehicles; the last passenger train left Newport in 1965. In 1917, the city paved Main Street. By the summer of 1930, traffic on the street had increased to 4,000 motor vehicles a day. The city sold its airport to the state of Vermont in the 1970s. === Military === Rogers' Rangers, a Vermont militia, were forced to retreat through the county following their attack on Saint-Francis, Quebec in 1759, during the French and Indian War. To confound their pursuers, they split up on the east shore of Lake Memphremagog. One group followed the Clyde River east. Another followed the Barton River south., page 1 In the early 19th century, the women of pioneer Calvin Arnold's household refused to continue to live there. It was located near what is now Clyde Pond, and subject to raids by Indians. During the American Civil War, the city had a scare when they received news of the St. Albans Raid. They thought these raids might repeat throughout the state, particularly at the south end of the lake. The militia was turned out. The ferry from Magog was met with determined-looking armed men, much to the captain's surprise, who had heard nothing about the raid. Armed Norwich University students were shipped in by train. Nothing happened and everyone was sent home after a few days. In 1891, the American Civil War Reunion Society of Vermont Officers held its annual reunion in Newport. In August 1942, a single-engine Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) training plane crashed into the lake near the west shore and the city, killing the pilot, the only occupant.
