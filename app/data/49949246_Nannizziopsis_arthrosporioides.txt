Nannizziopsis arthrosporioides is a keratinophilic microfungus in the family Onygenaceae that causes skin infections in reptiles, producing hyaline, thin- walled, small, sessile conidia and colonies with a strong skunk-like odour. It is distinguished by the production of long arthroconidia. ==References== ==Further reading== *Sigler, Lynne, Sarah Hambleton, and Jean A. Paré.
