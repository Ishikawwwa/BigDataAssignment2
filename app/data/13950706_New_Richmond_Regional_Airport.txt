New Richmond Regional Airport is the only public use airport in St. Croix County. ==History== The airport was commissioned by the FAA in July 1964 with a primary runway (Runway 13-31) and a turf runway (Runway 4-22). In 1992, a major construction project was completed. The primary runway was demolished and replaced by a new runway (Runway 14-32). The original hangar area located on the south end of the airport was also updated to allow additional hangars. A new aircraft parking apron was also constructed. In 1998, an additional taxi lane was added to the south hangar area. The hangar area was completely filled by the end of 1998 with 45 hangars. In 2000, a new hangar area was constructed on the north end of the airport. The new area accommodated a mix of 32 small and medium-sized hangars. A full-length parallel taxiway to runway 14-32 was also completed along with a small apron. In 2001, a second addition to the north aircraft parking apron was completed. In 2004, a corporate/business aviation hangar area was added to the north hangar area allowing the construction of up to seven large hangars. A third addition to the aircraft parking apron in the north hangar area was completed. An additional taxiway was also added to the north hangar area to accommodate additional private hangars. A grant from the Department of Homeland Security allowed the construction of a security fence and three automated security gates around the airport. In 2005, two new taxiways were added to the north hangar area to allow an additional 14 private and corporate hangars. In 2006, construction began on an extension to the primary runway and parallel taxiway to runway 14-32. The runway was completed in June 2007 and the parallel taxiway was completed in August 2007. The runway is now long. A helicopter landing apron and a connecting taxiway in the corporate hangar area were also completed as part of the 2006-2007 project.Picture of the airport - October 2007 In 2008, the airport completed the purchase of over adjoining the north side of the airport. The land will be used for future economic development. Reconstruction of the oldest portion of the primary runway started on September 8, along with the replacement and upgrading of the runway lighting system. Blast/overrun pads were installed on each end of the primary runway. A connecting taxiway in the corporate hangar area was also constructed. The runway was reopened for operations on October 4.https://web.archive.org/web/20091028065539/http://www.nrairport.com/2008%20Airport%20Construction.htm for construction photos In 2010, a taxiway, taxi lane and access road serving the northeast side of the airport was completed. The project provided the necessary infrastructure for future aviation related businesses. Additional security fencing and gates were also part of the 2010 project. In 2023, the south hangar area pavement originally installed in the fall of 1992, will undergo reconstruction. The existing asphalt will be removed along with 6 inch base course and will be replaced with a new 8 inch base course and 3 or 4 inches of asphalt, depending on location. The airport will begin developing an airport master plan in 2023. Engineering firm SEH was selected by the Wisconsin Bureau of Aeronautics in February of 2023 for this task. ==Airport businesses== East Metro Jet Center (full and self service fuel including 100LL, Jet A1, and MoGas, deicing, GPU, lav service, potable water service, Corporate Aircraft Association (CAA) member), Elevated Aircraft (aircraft sales), Indianhead Airways (piston and turbine aircraft maintenance), Perceptive Avionics (avionics sales and service), New Richmond Aero (piston aircraft maintenance), Proto Type Machine / Aerospace Hydraulics (precision made aircraft parts), Mike Demulling Flight Instruction (primary and advanced flight training), NDT Solutions (non-destructive testing and equipment manufacturing), New Richmond Airside Rental (rental vehicles for passengers and crew), Orion Airmotive (aircraft charter), Super Clean Aircraft (Tyler Vizenor - piston and turbine aircraft detailing) and Top Flight Avionics. ==Airport operations== The airport is funded from lease fees for hangar lots and taxes on the hangars.
