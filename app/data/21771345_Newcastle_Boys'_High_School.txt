Newcastle Boys' High School was a government-funded single-sex selective high school, located in Waratah, a suburb of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. The school was active between 1929 and 1976, after which time it became a co- educational non-selective school. == History == Newcastle Boys High School was established in 1929 when the Hill High School was split into two selective single-sex schools, the other being Newcastle Girls High School. Hill High School's campus was located on Newcastle Hill, at a site now occupied by Newcastle East Public School, and was referred to as "the School on the Hill". Newcastle Girls High School moved to a new campus in Hamilton, and Newcastle Boys High School moved to a new campus in Waratah in 1934, at which time Hill High School became Newcastle Junior Boys High School. Both Newcastle Boys and Newcastle Girls high schools carried on the traditions established by the original school, including use of the same motto and school colours. Newcastle Boys High School became non-selective and co-educational in 1977 and changed its name to Waratah High School that same year. Later it became Waratah Technology High School, and then Waratah Technology Campus of Callaghan College in 2000. == Headmasters == The Headmasters of Newcastle Boys High School were: * 1930–31 Robert Frederick Harvey * 1932–34 Charles Herbert Christmas * 1935–44 Norman Ross Mearns * 1945–47 William Pillans * 1948–63 Frank Harold Beard * 1964–74 Leonard Thomas Richardson * 1975–76 Victor Huish Webber (relieving) == School song == Newcastle Boys High School continued to sing the Newcastle High School song: words by a member of staff, R. G. Henderson MA set to the tune of "D'ye ken John Peel?", chosen by competition announced in 1913 in the school journal, "Novocastrian". When the boys moved to the plain at the Waratah site, they no longer climbed up The Hill and the first verse was re-written in 1943 by Mr Hodge. == Science scholarships == The following Newcastle Boys' High School students won scholarships to the Professor Harry Messel International Science School: Year Schoolboy 1962 Malcolm James Williams 1964 Peter Gordon Browne 1965 Ian Donald Henderson 1966 Grahame John Edgar 1967 Michael Duncan Daffey 1968 David Ian Cocking 1969 David Bruce Williams 1969 Graeme John Williams 1971 Danny James Llewellyn 1971 Ian Allen Watson 1973 Richard Kleeman 1973 Stephen Bruce Ticehurst 1974 John Ambler 1974 Dale Kleeman == Extra-curricular activities == The following Newcastle Boys' High School boys were awarded "Blues" by the New South Wales Combined High Schools Sports Association under the system which operated from 1957 to 1980:Bill Collins, Max Aitken and Bob Cork, One hundred years of public school sport in New South Wales 1889–1989 (Sydney, ca. 1990, New South Wales Department of School Education, p180ff) Year Sport Schoolboy 1960 Tennis D Kelso 1960 Athletics P Langley 1961 Tennis P Marshall 1962 Basketball D Collins 1962 Soccer J Smith 1962 Soccer J Thurlow 1962 Tennis P Marshall 1963 Cricket B Gibson 1963 Tennis W Harrison 1964 Cricket I Forrester 1964 Tennis C East 1965 Athletics P Wright 1967 Baseball G Gilmour 1967 Rugby League J Davis 1967 Rugby Union J Davis 1968 Soccer R O'Hearn 1969 Cricket G Gilmour 1970 Rugby League J Shield 1970 Soccer G Valentine 1971 Basketball T Antcliffe 1974 Basketball G Logan 1974 Sailing M Long ==Notable alumni== * Michael BackFreehills Brisbane managing partner * Reginald Ian Barrettjurist; Judge, Supreme Court of New South Wales (2001–2015) * Jonathan Bigginsentertainer, writer * Leigh Blackmorehorror writer, critic, editor, musicianBenjamin J.
