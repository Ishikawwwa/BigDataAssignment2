Nighthawk is an unincorporated community on the Similkameen River in Okanogan County, Washington, United States of America. It was named for a nearby (and now-closed) mine. Another source says that it was named after the nighthawks common to the area. ==Description== Nighthawk is a (mostly former) logging area along Loomis–Oroville Highway west-northwest of Oroville, Washington. Just north of Nighthawk is the Nighthawk–Chopaka Border Crossing, a 9 am – 5 pm Canada–US border crossing. Nighthawk is located along the former Great Northern Railroad (now BNSF). The town of Nighthawk used to be a booming mine town at the turn of the 20th century with hotels and a burlesque house, but now only has a population of about five people. The border crossing is usually known as "the Nighthawk crossing" on the Canadian side, though the official name of the Canadian-side locality is Chopaka. ==Climate== Climate data for Osoyoos West, BC 1981–2010 (metric units) about 14 km NE of Nighthawk Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Average high °C 2.0 5.9 12.5 17.9 22.1 25.7 29.4 29.1 23.8 15.8 7.1 1.6 16.1 Average mean °C −0.7 1.6 6.6 11.1 15.2 18.7 21.9 21.4 16.5 10.0 3.7 −0.9 10.4 Average low °C −3.4 −2.7 0.5 4.2 8.2 11.7 14.2 13.6 9.0 4.2 0.3 −3.4 4.7 Precipitation (cm) 2.88 2.23 2.40 2.42 3.71 4.17 2.46 1.73 1.49 1.86 3.38 3.58 32.32 Snowfall (cm) 14.6 4.6 1.7 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 5.7 17.0 43.8 Source: Environment Canada http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=1043&autofwd;=1 Climate data for Osoyoos West, BC 1981–2010 (English units) about 9 miles NE of Nighthawk Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Average high °F 35.6 42.6 54.5 64.2 71.8 78.3 84.9 84.4 74.8 60.4 44.8 34.9 61.0 Average mean °F 30.7 34.9 43.9 52.0 59.4 65.7 71.4 70.5 61.7 50.0 38.7 30.4 50.7 Average low °F 25.9 27.1 32.9 39.6 46.8 53.1 57.6 56.5 48.2 39.6 32.5 25.9 40.5 Precipitation (in) 1.13 0.88 0.94 0.95 1.46 1.64 0.97 0.68 0.59 0.73 1.33 1.41 12.72 Snowfall (in) 5.7 1.8 0.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.2 6.7 17.2 Source: Environment Canada http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=1043&autofwd;=1 ==References== * * Category:Unincorporated communities in Washington (state) Category:Unincorporated communities in Okanogan County, Washington Category:Ghost towns in Washington (state) Category:Populated places in the Okanagan Country
