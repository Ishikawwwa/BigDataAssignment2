Seventeen public libraries, seven college libraries, and one special library are members. NOBLE was the first automated resource sharing network in the state and the first Massachusetts library network on the Internet. It was established in 1980 by five libraries sharing their circulation system. By 1995, NOBLE served 32,000 college students and 522,000 residents and kept a database that featured more than 2.3 million items."Designing Internet services for a consortium: the NOBLE experience", Computers in Libraries, October 1, 1995 NOBLE is governed by its member libraries who approve the annual budget, establish NOBLE policies, and elect officers.
