Norman H. Greenhalgh (10 August 1914 – 1995) was an English footballer who played as a left back in the Football League with New Brighton and Everton either side of World War II. Greenhalgh started his career with his local club, Bolton Wanderers, but failed to break through into the first team. In 1935 he moved to New Brighton, where he suffered with appendicitis; after making a full recovery, he re-discovered his form and was sold to Everton. He made his Everton debut on 29 January 1938, and soon formed an effective partnership with Billy Cook. They helped Everton to the Football League title in 1939 before his career was interrupted by the war. Having already appeared for the Football League, he was selected to represent England in a wartime international against Scotland at Newcastle's St James' Park on 2 December 1939; England won 2–1 with goals from Henry Clifton and Tommy Lawton. He remained at Goodison Park until 1949, making a total of 115 appearances before moving to non-league Bangor City on a free transfer. ==References== Category:1914 births Category:Footballers from Bolton Category:1995 deaths Category:Men's association football fullbacks Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players Category:New Brighton A.F.C. players Category:Everton F.C. players Category:Bangor City F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:England men's wartime international footballers Category:English Football League representative players Category:English footballers
