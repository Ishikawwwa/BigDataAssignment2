In an attempt to bring back an elite hockey team to Trondheim, Nidaros Hockey was founded in the middle of 2015. On 12 March 2016, Nidaros Hockey was promoted to the 2016-17 First division, the second tier of Norwegian hockey. ==External links== *Official website Category:Ice hockey teams in Norway Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 2015 Category:2015 establishments in Norway Category:Sport in Trondheim
