Under the new system, voters have the option to rank up to five candidates for every local office. Voters whose first-choice candidates fare poorly will have their votes redistributed to other candidates in their ranking until one candidate surpasses the 50 percent threshold. If one candidate surpasses 50 percent in first-choice votes, then ranked-choice tabulations will not occur. Results below are unofficial, and absentee ballots currently remain uncounted. ===2017=== ===2013=== ==References== Category:New York City Council districts
