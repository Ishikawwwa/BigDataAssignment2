The area was introduced to Islam by an 11th-century preacher by the name of Shah Sultan Rumi who arrived in 1053 CE. After gaining the king's respect, Rumi was given a few villages, in particular Madanpur, as a rent-free area. Rumi was buried in Madanpur in 1075. In opposition to Company rule in India, a group of rebels known as the Pagal Panthis emerged in Greater Mymensingh in 1764 lasting up until 1852. Natorkona was one of the main locations effected by the Pagal Panthis. In response, a police outpost (thana) was set up by the British officers at Natorkona to assist their allied zamindars in suppressing the Pagal Panthi revolt. It is said that when the Pagal Panthis looted the outpost, the officers relocated to Kaliganj Bazar in Satpai mouza which is the site of the present Netrokona Sadar police station. However, the name of the thana remained as Natorkona, later being corrupted to Netrokona. In 1829, the British East India Company tried to takeover the Shah Sultan Rumi estate. This was contested by the guardians of the shrine who provided an old Persian document dating from 1082 CE. In response, the government abandoned the plan and granted the estate to the document holder; Syed Jalaluddin. Netrokona was made a thana in 1938 and made the capital of Netrokona Mahakuma in 1882. Amidst the Indian independence movement, influential nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose gave a speech at the Methar Patti grounds on 15 March 1939. The All India Peasant Conference was held from 8 to 10 April 1945 at the Parar grounds. During the Bangladesh Liberation War, the Pakistan Army captured 4 people and shot them dead at the Trimohani Bridge on29 April 1971. A battle took place on 9 December leading to the death of three freedom fighters. The Pakistani army was finally defeated in Netrokona Sadar in a last encounter at the Agricultural Farm where two freedom fighters were also killed.
