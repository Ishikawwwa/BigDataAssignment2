In 1496 Henry von Meseritz purchased the land from Hans von Borcke, and later passed through other noble families until the turn of the 19th century, when the property was owned by the von Brockhusen family (see: ), and managed by Anton Bogislav von Brockhusen. The land was finally held by the Holtz family until 1945, succeeded by the establishment of the People's Republic of Poland. Originally titled Nacmierz, the name was changed to Naćmierz in 2007. The settlement is currently home to Naćmierz Manor, which was built in the 18th century by the von Borcke family. It was rebuilt in the 19th century following damage to the building. == Geography == Naćmierz lies approximately south-east of Resko, north of Łobez, and north- east of the regional capital Szczecin. It is bordered to the west by the village of Przemysław, and to the east by Klępnica.
