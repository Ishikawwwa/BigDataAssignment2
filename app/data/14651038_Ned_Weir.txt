Edward Weir (born 1910, date of death unknown) was an Irish footballer who played for several clubs in the Scottish Football League. He was also a dual Irish international and played for both Ireland teams – the IFA XI and the FAI XI. After retiring as a player he managed Dundalk. ==Playing career== ===Club=== Weir was raised in Scotland and began playing football with his local church side, St Joseph's in Bonnybridge, before joining Camelon Juniors where he developed his skills as a left half. He spent three seasons with Falkirk but was largely a bit-part player. He then joined St Bernard's of Scottish Division Two, initially on loan. During the 1937–38 season, he was spotted by a Dublin football fan, Matt Murtagh. Murtagh subsequently recommended him to both the IFA and the FAI. Before the following season he was transferred to Clyde and helped them win the Scottish Cup in 1939.

Both associations, the Northern Ireland – based IFA and the Irish Free State – based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including Weir, played for both teams. Weir made his international debut with the IFA XI on 15 March 1939 in a 3–1 away defeat against Wales. This was his one and only appearance for the IFA XI. Weir also made three appearances for the FAI XI, all in 1939. Four days after playing for the IFA XI, he made his debut for the FAI XI on 19 March in a 2–2 draw with Hungary at the Mardyke. He then went on a European tour with the FAI XI and played in the team's last two internationals before the Second World War. The first of these was a return game against Hungary on 18 May which again finished as a 2–2 draw. He made his last appearance for the FAI XI on 23 May in a 1–1 draw with Germany.
