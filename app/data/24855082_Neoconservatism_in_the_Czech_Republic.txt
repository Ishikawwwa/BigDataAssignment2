The Czech Republic, like other post-communist European states, has had a fairly consistent pro-American foreign policy. This pro-Americanism makes Neoconservatism () in Europe more likely in post-communist European states. While other states in Europe have become hostile towards US policy since the 2003 invasion of Iraq the states of Central Europe (termed "new Europe" by Donald Rumsfeld) joined the American "coalition of the willing" in Iraq, contributing much-needed international legitimacy. The Bush administration has praised these states as sharing America's values and remembering the hardships of totalitarian regimes".Jenni Schaller, Neoconservatives Among Us?, A Study on former dissidents discourse, Perspectives: Central European Review of International Affairs; Winter2005/2006, Vol. 25, p43-62, 20p Many of the Czech politicians involved with the Velvet Revolution and the transition from communism to democracy express similar foreign policy views to American Neoconservatives. There are also many key Czech politicians affiliated to Neoconservative think tanks and organisations. Examples of these organisations include the Prague Security Studies Institute, an organisation who co-hosted the Neoconservative Democracy and Security International Conference.Neocon Europe, Democracy & Security International Conference, Accessed 27-October-2009 According to Jenni Schaller: > Neoconservatism, as a strain of political thought in the United States, has > been represented as "distinctly American" and Irving Kristol, often > considered the "godfather" of neoconservatism, emphatically states "[t]here > is nothing like neoconservatism in Europe" (Kristol 2003: 33).
