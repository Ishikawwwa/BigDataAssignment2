Novellara (Reggiano: or ) is a town and comune in the province of Reggio Emilia, Emilia-Romagna, Italy and has a population of 13,670. It is north of Reggio Emilia and has a railway station for the local train going from Reggio to Guastalla. ==History== The current name comes from the medieval Nubilaria, when the surrounding terrain was mostly covered by marshes, which favoured the formation of recurring fogs. The town was the seat of the Gonzaga family from the 13th century: here Guido Gonzaga, in the early 14th century, created an effectively independent lordship, which later evolved into the County of Novellara and Bagnolo, including grossly what is now the communal territory of Novellara and the nearby Bagnolo in Piano. thumb|right|Chiesa collegiata di Santo Stefano. After the Gonzaga's end, in 1728, the town passed to the Este of the Duchy of Modena, whose history Novellara followed until 1859, when it was annexed to the newly unified Italy. ==Main sights== *The Jesuit Convent *Chiesa Collegiata di Santo Stefano *The Rocca Gonzaga ("Gonzaga Castle").
