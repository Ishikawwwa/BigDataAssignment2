Natural History is the debut album by English rock band I Am Kloot, released to much eagerness from the British music press in 2001. The album was produced by Guy Garvey, lead singer for the Manchester-based band Elbow. Although reaching a low chart placing outside the top 100, the band built up a dedicated and loyal fanbase through touring and promotion. The album itself is widely viewed as some of I Am Kloot's best work to date. Prior to the album's release, the band released two singles on Ugly Man Records: "Titanic"/"To You" in November 1999, and "Twist"/"86 TV's" in March 2000. The album itself spawned two further singles: "Dark Star" in February 2001, and "Morning Rain" in July 2001. All songs written by John Harold Arnold Bramwell. == Track listing == 1\.
