Its duties consisted of patrolling the North Sea Fishing fleet, convoy escort work, and reconnaissance. The unit operated Bristol Blenheims until 1942, before re-equipping with the Bristol Beaufighter. In 1941 the unit introduced torpedoes and primarily operated in an anti-shipping role for the rest of the war, with a focus on anti-U-boat work from early 1945.
