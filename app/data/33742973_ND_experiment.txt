Neutral Detector (ND) is a detector for particle physics experiments created by the team of physicists in the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics, Novosibirsk, Russia. Experiments with the ND were conducted from 1982 to 1987 at the e+e− storage ring VEPP-2M in the energy range 2E=0.5-1.4 GeV. == Physics == At the beginning of 80s the leading cross sections of the electron- positron annihilation in the final states with charged particles were measured in the energy range 2E=0.5-1.4 GeV. Processes with the neutral particles in the final state were less studied. To investigate the radiative decays of the \rho^0, \omega, and \phi mesons and other processes involving photons, \pi^0, and \eta mesons the ND was constructed. Its distinguishing features are defined by the specially designed electromagnetic calorimeter based on NaI(Tl) scintillation counters.
