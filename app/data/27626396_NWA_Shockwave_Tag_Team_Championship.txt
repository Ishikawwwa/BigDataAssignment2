The NWA Shockwave Tag Team Championship was a professional wrestling tag team championship in NWA Shockwave (NWA-SW) and the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). It was the original title of the CyberSpace Wrestling Federation promotion and was later recognized by the NWA as a regional title. It was introduced as the CSWF Tag Team Championship on October 19, 2002. It was established as an NWA heavyweight championship in 2005 following the promotion's admission into the NWA. The promotion became NWA: Cyberspace, and later NWA Shockwave, with the title remaining active until its retirement in 2006.McCaffrey, Sean. "The Third Annual DOI 250." DeclarationofIndependents.net.
