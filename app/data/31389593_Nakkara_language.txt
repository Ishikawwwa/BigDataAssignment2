Nakkara (Na-kara) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Nagara people of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is also spelled Nakara or Nagara and also called Kokori. == Phonology == === Consonants === Consonant chart Bilabial Apical Laminal Dorsal Alveolar Retroflex Palatal Velar Stop b d ɖ ɟ g Nasal m n ɳ ɲ ŋ Lateral l ɭ Rhotic r/ɾ ɽ Semivowel w j Stops have both voiced and voiceless allophones, depending on their position in the word. Furthermore, a stop length variation is present, which is only contrastive in morpheme-medial positions. This can be interpreted as either gemination, or as evidence for the existence of two separate stop series, with a suprasegmental hypothesis being mostly ruled out. The tapped and trilled allophones of /r/ are in free variation. === Vowels === Vowel chart Front Central Back Close i u Mid e o Open a ==References== Category:Maningrida languages Category:Indigenous Australian languages in the Northern Territory
