The discography of the South Korean boy group NCT consists of three studio albums and thirteen singles. The multi-national and unlimited boy group was formed and managed by the Korean entertainment company SM Entertainment in 2016. This page compiles the discography of NCT as a whole group. NCT had their first major release with NCT 2018 Empathy in 2018, featuring a total of eighteen members at the time under the name NCT 2018, marking the first singular-year project to involve all current members and sub-units of NCT. It was also the first NCT release to receive a platinum KMCA certificate following its introduction in the same year. They have subsequently released two more studio albums. == Albums == === Studio albums === List of studio albums, with selected details, chart positions, sales, and certifications Title Details Peak positions Sales Certifications KOR Gaon Weekly Album Chart: * * * * BEL (FL) CAN NCT chart positions on the Canadian Albums Chart: * HUN Peaks on the Hungarian Weekly Album Charts: * * * * * * * JPN Oricon Album Chart: * * * * * * * * * * * * JPN Hot Billboard Japan Hot Albums: * * * * * * * * * * * * UK Down.
