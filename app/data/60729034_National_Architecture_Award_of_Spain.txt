The National Architecture Award of Spain () is an honor granted annually by the Government of Spain. It was first given in 1932, had a hiatus during the Civil War, and resumed in 1944, although it is not convened every year. At its establishment it was awarded to a particular work, but since 2001 it has been awarded to an architect for the whole of their work. In 2004, the National Architecture Award was "recreated", the was restored and, in addition, the was created, which recognized a specific building, but only those dedicated to housing. The latter has simply been called the National Housing Award since 2009. In 2013, the National Architecture Award was once again combined into a single prize. The winner is selected by a jury (which nominates a candidate or declares the award will not be given), and the award is granted by order of the Minister of Development. ==Winners== ===1932–2000=== Image Year(s) Architect(s) Work Location Ref 80px 1932 Manuel Sánchez Arcas and Eduardo Torroja Madrid 1933 Museum of Modern Art Project Not built 1934 Not given 1935 Project for permanent fine arts exhibition building 1936–1943 Not convened 80px 1944 Completion of Almudena Cathedral Madrid 1945 Juan González Cebrián Architecture of the Spanish Garden 1946 Francisco Javier Sáenz de Oiza and Luis Laorga Project for the Plaza of the Aqueduct of Segovia Segovia 1947 and Federico Garcia del Villar Ordination of the Calle de Toledo 1948 Contest for a mountain hermitage in La Mancha 1949–1953 Not convened 1954 Francisco Javier Sáenz de Oiza and José Luis Romany Aranda Chapel project in the Camino de Santiago 1955 Jorge Oteiza Chapel proposal in the Camino de Santiago 80px 1956 and Madrid 1957 Juan Moya Arderíus 1958 Pablo Pintado y Riba 1959 1960 Javier Barroso Ladrón de Guevara and Ángel Orbe Cano Residency project for artists in homage to Velázquez 1961 Fernando Higueras and Rafael Moneo Preliminary project of Artistic Restoration Center Madrid 1962 Bandstand template project 80px 1963 Salamanca 1964 Not given 1965 and Antonio López García Monumental plaza Pedraza, Segovia 1966–1967 Not given 80px 1968 Fernando Garrido Rodríguez Algeciras 1969 and Ángel Díaz Domínguez Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía of Madrid (currently dedicated to the Museo del Traje) Madrid 1970 Not given 1971 and Julio Vidaurre Jofre Central Model for 1972–1973 Not given 1974 Alejandro de la Sota University of Seville classroom Seville 1975 Ice skating rink Seville 1976–1986 Not convened 1987 Residences in Calle Bertran, 113 Barcelona 1988–1989 Not given 1990 PGOU Torrent, Valencia 1991 Not given 80px 1992 Barcelona 80px 1993 Antonio Cruz Villalón and Antonio Ortiz García Seville 1994 Not given 80px 1995 Enric Miralles and Carme Pinós (finalized by Pinós) Escuela-Hogar Morella 1996 Mariano Bayón PAD 96 80px 1997 A Coruña 1998 Not given 1999 Manuel de las Casas Faculty of Health Sciences A Coruña 80px 2000 Córdoba ===2001–present=== Year Winner Ref 2001 2002 Miguel Fisac 2003 2004 Matilde Ucelay 2005 Santiago Calatrava 2006 Oriol Bohigas 2007 Not given 2008 Not given 2009 2010 2011 Not given 2012 Not given 2013 Not given 2014 Juan Navarro Baldeweg 2015 Rafael Moneo 2016 and 2017 Not given 2018 2019 Álvaro Siza Vieira ==References== ==External links== * Category:1932 establishments in Spain Category:Architecture awards Category:Awards established in 1932 Category:Spanish awards
