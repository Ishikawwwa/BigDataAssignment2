Notre-Dame-du-Sacré-Cœur (also known as Notre-Dame) was a small municipality in southwestern Quebec, Canada, three kilometers (2 miles) from the southern shore of the Saint Lawrence River. It was a suburb of Montreal until it was annexed to the city of Brossard in 1978. The boundaries of Notre-Dame-du- Sacré-Coeur were fairly simple as the municipality had the exact shape of a rectangle. Today, its former location corresponds to the western part of the A section of Brossard; which is bordered by Alain street to the northwest, Grande-Allée Boulevard to the northeast, Baillargeon street to the southeast and Lapinière Boulevard to the southwest. ==History== Notre-Dame-du-Sacré-Cœur was formed from the Municipalité de la Paroisse de La Prairie de la Magdeleine in 1950. James Darby was the last mayor of this city, from 1967 to 1978. On March 25, 1978, Notre-Dame-du-Sacré-Cœur was annexed to the city of Brossard to solve the problem of providing sufficient services to and maintaining an adequate municipal government for such a small geographical area. Notre-Dame had strong ties with the city of Brossard as its territory was almost completely surrounded by Brossard and its schools were served by the Brossard school board. Immediately following the merger, the streets of Notre-Dame-du- Sacré-Cœur were renamed and integrated into the A section of Brossard. James- Darby Park in Brossard (located at the intersection of Asselin and Anthony streets) is named in honour of the last mayor of Notre-Dame-du-Sacré-Cœur. The park includes a basketball court and a pétanque playing area. ==Government== Notre-Dame was governed by a mayor and six councillors elected every 2 years. Despite being a small municipality, Notre-Dame had its own police service. The city hall of Notre-Dame-du-Sacré-Coeur was located on Domville street. ==Education== Notre-Dame-du-Sacré-Coeur was served by two catholic primary schools: Notre-Dame and St-Michel. Notre-Dame school was located on Riendeau street. St-Michel school was located on Pauline street. Both schools were handled by the Brossard school board. == Street name changes == Notre Dame Brossard Booker Anthony Domville Alexandre Pauline Aline Riendeau Auteuil Stedman Auclair Sylvain Alain 5th av Grande-Allée 6th av Aubry 7th av Arpin 8th av Asselin 9th av Alarie 10th av Audette * Note: 5th avenue was renamed Grande-Allée in 1971. ==Location in 1978== ==See also== * Brossard **History of Brossard ==References== * Marigot: Historic Dictionary of Brossard-N * Marigot: Les Nouvelles Villes Category:Populated places established in 1950 Category:Populated places disestablished in 1978 Category:Brossard Category:Communities in Montérégie Category:Former municipalities in Quebec
