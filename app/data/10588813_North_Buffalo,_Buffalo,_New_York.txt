This area along Hertel Avenue is now locally known as Little Italy. Many Italians in North Buffalo migrated from the West Side in the 1970s and 1980s, when Puerto Ricans first began to settle in traditionally Italian-American neighborhoods west of Richmond Avenue. The Italian Village Festival, now called the Italian Heritage Festival, moved from Connecticut Street on the West Side to Hertel Avenue in North Buffalo in 1988. From the 1950s until the late 1970s, North Buffalo was the historic center of Buffalo's Jewish community. Jews first settled in North Buffalo in the 1920s, with Jewish developers building a sizable number of single-family houses and two- flats in the North Park/Hertel Avenue area. The growth of the neighborhood's Jewish population rapidly accelerated in the 1950s, when urban renewal in the Lower East Side, and racial transition exacerbated by blockbusting in the Hamlin Park neighborhood, displaced the formerly large Jewish population of those communities. Although the majority of Jews in the Buffalo area now live in suburban Amherst and Williamsville, many remain in North Buffalo; particularly secular and Orthodox Jews. The neighborhood is home to several Orthodox synagogues and schools,jewish virtual library and institutions such as the Schvitz.Mary Kunz Goldman tales from bathhouse Because of its pedestrian-oriented environment; proximity to downtown Buffalo, the University at Buffalo, and suburban office parks; and high-quality 1920s-era housing stock, North Buffalo is experiencing an influx of young professional homebuyers. ==Notable events== For many years, North Buffalo held the annual Italian Heritage and Food Festival along Hertel Avenue.
