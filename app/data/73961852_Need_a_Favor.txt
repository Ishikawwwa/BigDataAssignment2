Jelly Roll sings in the chorus, "I only talk to God when I need a favor / And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer / So, who the hell am I, who the hell am I / To expect a Savior o-o-oh / If I only talk to God when I need a favor / But God I need a favor / Amen... Amen". ==Critical reception== Lesley Janes of The Nash News wrote, "The combination of rock and country is easy to find on this song. He speaks with raw authenticity that it's impossible not to believe every word he sings. Everyone needs a helping hand at times, and Jelly Roll is able to capture that perfectly on this track. The line, "Who the Hell am I to expect a savior," brings true humility to the forefront." Jess of Taste of Country wrote, "Both sonically and lyrically, the song feels like a prime track for the soundtrack of an upcoming Yellowstone episode." ==Live performances== Jelly Roll performed the song at the 2023 CMT Music Awards. ==Charts== Chart performance for "Need a Favor" Chart (2023) Peak position ==References== Category:2022 singles Category:2022 songs Category:Jelly Roll (singer) songs Category:BBR Music Group singles
