Nigeria has competed at fourteen Commonwealth Games, from 1950. Nigeria did not attend four Games, in 1962, 1978 (in protest at New Zealand's sporting policies towards South Africa during apartheid), 1986 and 1998 (due to suspension). Nigeria has won at least one medal at every Games attended, including a high of thirty-seven in 1994. The first medal in 1950 was won by Joshua Majekodunmi in the High Jump. ==Medals== Games Gold Silver Bronze Total 1950 Auckland 0 1 0 1 1954 Vancouver 1 3 3 7 1958 Cardiff 0 1 1 2 1962 Perth did not attend did not attend did not attend did not attend 1966 Kingston 3 4 3 10 1970 Edinburgh 2 0 0 2 1974 Christchurch 3 3 4 10 1978 Edmonton did not attend did not attend did not attend did not attend 1982 Brisbane 5 0 8 13 1986 Edinburgh did not attend did not attend did not attend did not attend 1990 Auckland 5 13 7 25 1994 Victoria 11 13 13 37 1998 Kuala Lumpur did not attend (suspended) did not attend (suspended) did not attend (suspended) did not attend (suspended) 2002 Manchester 5 3 11 19 2006 Melbourne 4 6 7 17 2010 Delhi 11 8 14 33 2014 Glasgow 11 11 14 36 2018 Gold Coast 9 9 6 24 2022 Birmingham 12 9 14 35 Total 82 84 105 271 ==References== https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/547523-commonwealth-games- nigerias-12-gold-medals-all-won-by-women-full-list.html
