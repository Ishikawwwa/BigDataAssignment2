Nama-i farhangistan (; translated: Writings of the Academy), was a Persian- language magazine that was published monthly in Tehran between 1943 and 1947. A total of 10 issues in 5 volumes were published. ==Description== The magazine was the publication organ of the Academy of Iran (pers. Farhangistān-i Īrān), founded in 1935, the predecessor of the Academy for Persian Language and Literature, and thus became an important pioneer for linguistic research and language reforms in the Pahlavi era. Among the members of the Academy were well-known politicians and diplomats, numerous famous Iranian writers and scholars of that time, such as Abbas Iqbal (1896-1955), the founder of the magazine Yadgar, and Ali-Akbar Dehchoda (1879-1956), the co-founder of the magazine Sur-e Esrafil and author of the Dictionary of Dehchoda (Loghat-nāme- ye Dehchodā) - the most important and comprehensive dictionary of the Persian language and literature. The Academy, whose primary objective was to preserve and protect the Persian language, in particular used the journal for publishing Persian equivalents to replace certain foreign words. From 1995 on the publication organ experienced a quarterly reprint of the same name. ==References== ==External links== * Online-Version: Nāma-i farhangistān * Digital Collections: Arabische, persische und osmanisch-türkische Periodika Category:1943 establishments in Iran Category:1947 disestablishments in Iran Category:Defunct magazines published in Iran Category:Magazines established in 1943 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1947 Category:Magazines published in Tehran Category:Monthly magazines published in Iran Category:Persian-language magazines Category:Pahlavi Iran
