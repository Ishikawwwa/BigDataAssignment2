The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCMNS) is the largest museum of its kind in the Southeastern United States. It is the oldest established museum in North Carolina, located in Raleigh. In 2013, it had about 1.2 million visitors, and it was the state's most visited museum or historic destination among visitors. The museum has six facilities on five campuses: the Nature Exploration Center and Nature Research Center on Jones Street in downtown Raleigh, the Prairie Ridge Ecostation satellite facility and outdoor classroom in Northwest Raleigh near William B. Umstead State Park, the former North Carolina Museum of Forestry in Whiteville, and the former Grifton Nature & Science Center in Grifton. The newest facility, the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences at Greenville, was announced in 2020 and opened to the public on September 18th, 2021. NCMNS is a division of the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. == History == thumb|Former logo The North Carolina State Museum was created in 1879 by combining two existing state- owned collections of geologic and agricultural specimens. The museum was originally housed in the Briggs Building on Fayetteville Street. The museum's collections, outreach and education programs, and status grew over the next 60 years under the stewardship of H.H. Brimley. As part of the Department of Agriculture, in 1887, the museum moved to a former hotel on Edenton Street across from the capitol building. An annex was added in 1899, but the entire facility was replaced by a purpose-built building in 1924. The facility was later renamed the North Carolina State Museum of Natural History. In the 1950s and again in the 1990s, shifts in education further expanded the museum's holdings as universities donated their collections to the state. In 1986, it became the North Carolina State Museum of Natural Sciences. A new building opened later and NCMNS became the largest natural history museum in the Southeast. In 2000, the museum expanded with a new location: the Museum of Forestry in Whiteville. This facility was later overhauled and reopened in 2015 as the NC Museum of Natural Sciences in Whiteville. Another location was added in 2004, with the opening of the Prairie Ridge Ecostation for Wildlife and Learning. The museum expanded its downtown campus in 2012 with the adjacent Nature Research Center. The collection now contains more than 1.7 million specimens of amphibians, reptiles, birds, fish, mammals, invertebrates, invertebrate and vertebrate fossils, plants, geology, and meteorites. NCMNS is administered by the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. On July 14 2014, a dinosaur replica along with other items were stolen from NCMNS by two accomplices. The duo turned themselves in on July 17 2014. The replica, along with the other items were recovered. == Nature Exploration Center == === First floor === thumb|225px|right|Nature Exploration Center (NEC) front entrance * Natural Treasures of North Carolina contains dioramas of various wildlife and artifacts pertaining to nature in North Carolina. * Coastal North Carolina includes exhibits of fish native to North Carolina's coast and inland waterways. * WRAL 3-D Theater – 3-D films are shown daily in this 250-seat venue. * Box Office - Although entrance to the museum is free, tickets to the WRAL 3-D theater and the special exhibits (located on the 2nd floor) must be purchased either online or at the box office near the main entrance. === Second floor === * The North Carolina: Mountains to the Sea exhibit displays North Carolina's natural habitats from the western mountains through the central Piedmont and on to the Coastal Plain highlighting the interrelationships between them. * Underground North Carolina features gems and minerals of North Carolina, as well as ground, soil, and seismic displays. * The Nature's Explorers exhibit covers the museum's beginnings, showing the tools and techniques naturalists used 100 years ago to collect and preserve specimens. * The Discovery Room is a family-oriented hands-on exhibit for exploring the natural world using a combination of natural, live, and man-made objects. * Special Exhibition gallery. * A covered bridge to the Nature Research Center, which also has a timeline on display. === Third floor === thumb|Dinosaur displays at North Carolina Museum of Natural Science * Prehistoric North Carolina chronicles prehistoric life in the state and throughout the southeastern United States, and contains the reconstruction of an Eremotherium giant ground sloth excavated by the museum. * The Terror of the South exhibit features fossil skeletons, including an Acrocanthosaurus. * The Tropical Connections section is anchored by a large interactive globe which allows visitors to highlight the climate regions of the Earth.

The facility opened a Nature PlaySpace on Saturday, September 28, 2013. === North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences at Whiteville === The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences at Whiteville, North Carolina formerly known as the North Carolina Museum of Forestry, is a satellite facility of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Its mission is to celebrate the natural history and cultural heritage of North Carolina's forests through interpretive exhibits, educational programming, and the preservation of natural and man-made materials that demonstrate the ongoing relationship of forests and people. Displays and interactive exhibits include an outdoor Tree Trail and Fossil Dig Pit, and the museum offers educational program experiences and special events. === North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences at Contentnea Creek === The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences at Contentnea Creek, formerly known as the Grifton Nature & Science Center, is a satellite facility and outdoor classroom located in Grifton, North Carolina. It features hiking and paddling trails centered around Contentnea Creek, along with an observatory and outdoor classroom. === North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences at Greenville === The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences at Greenville, North Carolina formerly known as A Time For Science (ATFS), is a satellite facility of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences located in Greenville, North Carolina. It and the Grifton Nature and Science Center were acquired through a partnership between NCMNS and ATFS. The center was renovated with new exhibits being added and reopened in September 2021. The Museum at Greenville is largely based on the Raleigh facility, but with more exhibits focusing on subjects relevant to northeastern North Carolina such as pirates and pollinators, and includes resources from East Carolina University. ==Notable annual events== NCMNS hosts many special events through the year. The most notable are: On Groundhog Day, February 2, Sir Walter Wally makes his annual prediction for the arrival of the upcoming spring. Sir Walter has a 58% accuracy rating, which has earned him nationwide recognition for his prognostication ability. BugFest, held in mid-September every year, is a free day-long festival devoted to insects. This event attracts more than 35,000 visitors per year. A smaller version of the festival, called BugFest South, is held at the Whiteville facility in May or June. NCMNS participates in First Night Raleigh each year on December 31. In 2012, First Night drew 80,000 people to the blocks around the museum. == Acquisition of the Dueling Dinosaurs == The Dueling Dinosaurs is an extremely well-preserved and scientifically important specimen from Montana of a Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus possibly locked in combat. First found in 2006, there were unsuccessful attempts by the fossil's finders to sell it to museums or private collectors for over a decade until the NCMNS reached out in 2016, prompting negotiations to purchase the fossil, with funds being raised by the nonprofit Friends of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Legal issues significantly slowed these negotiations until they were resolved in 2020, leading the museum to announce its acquisition of the fossils as part of its permanent collection. The fossils are set to be put on display in the Nature Research Center. After construction delays, the Dueling Dinosaurs exhibit will open in 2023. == References == == External links == * Official website Category:Natural history museums in North Carolina Category:Museums in Raleigh, North Carolina Category:NASA Museum Alliance Category:Smithsonian Institution affiliates Category:Natural Science Collections Alliance members Category:Nature centers in North Carolina Category:Dinosaur museums in the United States Category:Paleontology in North Carolina Category:Insectariums Category:Butterfly houses Category:1879 establishments in North Carolina Category:Museums established in 1879
