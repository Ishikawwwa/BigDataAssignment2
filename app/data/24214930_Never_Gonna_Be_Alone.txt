It began airing on VH1 and Fuse on November 23. The video tells the story of a young woman (played by Emily Bett Rickards) who has lost her father and depicts the love between the two. === Synopsis === The video opens with the young woman in a limousine being taken to her wedding. She is holding a fake blue flower with her bouquet. As she walks down the aisle, she looks back at her mother and father, who are smiling proudly. The video uses a series of flashbacks - the woman's high school graduation, her father seeing her off to prom, and her father teaching her how to ride a bike - to highlight the shared memories between the two. A final flashback shows the father's funeral, where it is revealed that he passed when she was just a little girl. At the funeral, the girl holds two fake flowers in her hand, one yellow and one blue. She tosses the yellow one into her father's grave. The events in the flashbacks are shown again from a different perspective; each time the girl looks up at her father and sees him disappear in a shimmer of light. Back at the wedding, the girl is still looking back, seeing her father's ghost surrounded in light. The girl places the blue flower in her new husband's breast pocket, and the two wed. As they are leaving the church, the video cuts to her father once more, smiling proudly. He disappears for the final time, his daughter now fully grown up. Throughout, the video is intercut with scenes of the band singing in a room with a large, light-filled backdrop. == Use in media == The song is featured on the soundtrack of the Brazilian soap opera, Caminho das Índias. == Tracklisting == ;International Promo CD #"Never Gonna Be Alone" ;Japanese Promo "Best Of" EP #"Never Gonna Be Alone" #"Gotta Be Somebody" #"If Today Was Your Last Day" #"Photograph" #"Rockstar" #"Someday" #"Feelin' Way Too Damn Good" #"How You Remind Me" #"Too Bad" #"Breathe" #"Leader Of Men" == Charts == === Weekly charts === Chart (2009–10) Peak position === Year end charts === Chart (2010) Position US Adult Contemporary (Billboard) 40 US Adult Pop Songs (Billboard) 28 ==References== Category:2008 songs Category:2009 singles Category:Nickelback songs Category:Song recordings produced by Robert John "Mutt" Lange Category:Songs written by Chad Kroeger Category:Songs written by Robert John "Mutt" Lange Category:Roadrunner Records singles Category:Music videos directed by Nigel Dick
