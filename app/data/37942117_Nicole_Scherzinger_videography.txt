Her role as the lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls spotlighted her as a singer, which led to collaborating with other artists and appeared in three music videos in 2006, including a collaboration with P.

After the group's hiatus, Scherzinger became a judge on The Sing-Off for its two first seasons and won the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars. After her stint as guest judge on the British X Factor was favorably received by viewers and producers, Scherzinger was hired to be a main judge on the first season of the American X Factor. Her role was met with several controversies while her performance was panned by critics. Meanwhile, Scherzinger's debut album Killer Love (2011), released music videos for the singles "Poison", "Don't Hold Your Breath", "Right There", "Wet" and "Try with Me". The following year, Scherzinger briefly appeared in Barry Sonnenfeld's Men in Black 3 for which she received a Teen Choice Award nomination, and found greater success as a judge on the British X Factor where she appeared as a judge for four series (2012–2013, 2016-2017). She received a nomination for National Television Award for Best TV Judge (2017). Scherzinger released four music videos from Big Fat Lie (2014), which includes lead single "Your Love".
