"Nobody Does It Better" is a power ballad and the theme song for the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Composed by Marvin Hamlisch with lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager, the song was produced by Richard Perry and performed by Carly Simon. It was the first Bond theme song to be titled differently from the name of the film since Dr. No (1962), although the phrase "the spy who loved me" is included in the lyrics. The song was released as a single from the film's soundtrack album, and became a major worldwide hit. Among the most successful Bond themes, the song spent three weeks at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, kept out of the top spot by Debby Boone's "You Light Up My Life". It hit No. 1 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart, where it stayed for seven weeks, becoming the No. 1 Adult Contemporary hit of 1977. The song was certified Gold by the RIAA, signifying sales of one million copies in the US. It also reached No. 7 on the UK Singles Chart, and was certified Silver by the BPI.Whitburn, Joel (2006).

London: Guinness World Records Limited The song received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Song in 1978, losing both to "You Light Up My Life" from the 1977 film of the same title. At the 20th Annual Grammy Awards held in 1978, "Nobody Does It Better" received a nomination for Song of the Year, and Simon was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female. In 2004, "Nobody Does it Better" was honored by the American Film Institute as the 67th greatest film song as part of their 100 Years Series. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked it the third-greatest James Bond theme song, while Billboard ranked it the second-greatest. In 2021, USA Today crowned "Nobody Does it Better" the greatest James Bond Theme Song. The song has been performed live by Celine Dion and Radiohead; indeed, Radiohead's lead singer, Thom Yorke, called it the "sexiest song ever written". ==Background and composition== "Nobody Does It Better" is Simon's longest-charting hit, as well as the most successful hit of hers that she did not write herself. Her earlier hit "You're So Vain" spent three weeks at No. 1; however, its chart run was two months shorter than that of "Nobody Does It Better".Whitburn, Joel (2003). Top Pop Singles, 1955–2002 The title of the theme was later used for Simon's 1999 greatest hits compilation, The Very Best of Carly Simon: Nobody Does It Better. Lyrically, "Nobody Does It Better" is a "lust-drunk anthem" about James Bond's sexual prowess. In a 1977 documentary on the making of The Spy Who Loved Me, Marvin Hamlisch said that the decision to ask Simon to perform the song was made after lyricist Carole Bayer Sager remarked that the lyrics sounded "incredibly vain", in reference to Simon's 1972 song "You're So Vain". ==Reception== Billboard described "Nobody Does It Better" as a "typically inventive and bombastic" James Bond theme song, stating that Simon sings it "as if she believed sincerely in the superhuman love powers of 007." Cash Box said that it is "strictly star material in every detail" and that it has "a good enough melody to stand on its own," even if it wasn't a James Bond theme song. ==Accolades== Year Award Category Recipient Result Ref 1978 Academy Awards Best Original Song Marvin Hamlisch and Carole Bayer Sager British Academy Film Awards Best Film Music Marvin Hamlish Golden Globe Awards Best Original Song Marvin Hamlisch and Carole Bayer Sager Grammy Awards Song of the Year Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female Carly Simon ==Track listing== ;7" single * "Nobody Does It Better" – 3:30 * "After the Storm" – 2:46 ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1977–1978) Peak position Argentina 4 Australia (Kent Music Report) 8 Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary 1 Canadian RPM Top Singles 2 France 5 Ireland 1 Norway 5 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 2 U.S. Billboard Easy Listening 1 U.S. Cash Box Top 100 2 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1977) Rank Canadian RPM Top Singles 35 UK Singles Chart 49 US Billboard Hot 100 83 US Billboard Adult Contemporary 1 US Cash Box Top 100 14 Chart (1978) Rank Australia (Kent Music Report) 39 ==Certifications== ==See also== * James Bond music * Outline of James Bond ==References== ==External links== * Lyrics of this song * Carly Simon's Official Website * Category:Rock ballads Category:1977 singles Category:Carly Simon songs Category:Irish Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Love themes Category:Songs from James Bond films Category:The Spy Who Loved Me (film) Category:Songs written by Carole Bayer Sager Category:Songs written by Marvin Hamlisch Category:Elektra Records singles Category:Pop ballads Category:1977 songs Category:1970s ballads Category:Song recordings produced by Richard Perry
