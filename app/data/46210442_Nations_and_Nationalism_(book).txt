Nations and Nationalism is an influential 1983 book by the philosopher Ernest Gellner, in which the author expands on his theory of nationalism. O'Leary describes the book as "Gellner's most elaborate statement on the subject (of nationalism); because it is largely an expansion of the themes first sketched in Thought and Change.... he never repudiated any of the core propositions advanced in these texts", but he clarifies and qualifies some of them further in his Encounters with Nationalism (1994). ==See also== *Gellner's theory of nationalism *Nations and Nationalism (journal) ==Sources== * ==References== ==External links== *Ernest Gellnerâ€™s Nations and Nationalism: A book critique.
