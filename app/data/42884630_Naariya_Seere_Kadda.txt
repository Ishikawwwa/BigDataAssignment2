Only Naveen Krishnas performance holds up, while Rekha Das does a brilliant job in balancing sequences in the average cinematography by Vishnuvardhan". BSS from Deccan Herald wrote "The director makes a hash of a ready-made, worn out story. Ravichandran, the entertainer-actor, is lost in hideous wigs, stubble and pot-belly; a makeover is long overdue. He owes his fans at least that much. Nikhitha goes through the motions, while Naveen, Harshika, Shivaram, Shobhraj and Arvind are all wasted. A pity". A critic from Bangalore Mirror wrote "Even Ravichandran enters the house as a 'protector.' The story stutters, hitches, drags and puts you to sleep mode â€” if you are lucky that is.Laced with many uninspiring sequences, there is a mismatch about almost everything in the film.Even Ravichandran is made to act as if it were a television sitcom". == References == Category:2010 films Category:2010s Kannada-language films Category:Indian romantic comedy films Category:2010 romantic comedy films Category:Films scored by V.
