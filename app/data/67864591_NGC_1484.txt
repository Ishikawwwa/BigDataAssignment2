NGC 1484 is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Eridanus, 48 million light-years from Earth. It is part of the Fornax Cluster, that contains approximately 200 galaxies, making it the second richest galaxy cluster in 100 million light-years after the Virgo Cluster. It was discovered by William Herschel on November 28, 1837. Its distance and size on the night sky convert to an actual size of 35,000 light years, only a third or one-quarter the size of the Milky Way Galaxy. == See also == *NGC 1399, central galaxy of the Fornax Cluster *NGC 1531 and NGC 1532, pair of nearby Fornax Cluster galaxies *NGC 1365 *NGC 1316 == References == Category:Barred spiral galaxies 1484 Category:Eridanus (constellation) Category:Fornax Cluster 014071
