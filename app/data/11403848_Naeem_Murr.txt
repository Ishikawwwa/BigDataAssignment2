His first novel, The Boy, concerns a father's search for a strange orphan he adopted into his family who has fled to live in a slum as a prostitute. It was a New York Times Notable Book. A second novel, The Genius of the Sea, explores the fears and failures of a social-worker coming to terms with his life by talking with a man who now occupies his dead mother's apartment. His most recent book The Perfect Man was published in 2007 to critical acclaim. The novel was awarded The Commonwealth Writers' Prize for the Best Book of Europe/South Asia, and was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize. Set in the 1950s, The Perfect Man details the life of an unwanted boy sent first from India to London, and then to small-town Missouri, and the complex web of relationships he develops as he matures. Murr has received many awards for his writing, including a Lambda Literary Award, a Lannan Residency Fellowship, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a PEN Open Book Award and a Stegner Fellowship. ==Bibliography== *The Boy (1998) *The Genius of the Sea (2003) *The Perfect Man (2007) (UK publication in 2006) ==External links== *Official website Category:21st-century English novelists Category:Living people Category:University of Missouri faculty Category:British people of Lebanese descent Category:1965 births Category:Lambda Literary Award winners Category:English male novelists Category:21st-century English male writers
