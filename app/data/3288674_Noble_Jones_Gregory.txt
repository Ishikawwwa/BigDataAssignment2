In 1958 Gregory sought re-election to his seat but was defeated in the Democratic primary by Frank Stubblefield; he won the general election. After being defeated, Gregory returned to the banking and investment business in Mayfield. He is buried in Maplewood Cemetery in Mayfield. ==References== Category:1897 births Category:1971 deaths Category:People from Mayfield, Kentucky Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives from Kentucky Category:20th-century American politicians
