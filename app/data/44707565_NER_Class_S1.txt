The NER Class S1 (LNER Class B14) was a class of 4-6-0 steam locomotives of the North Eastern Railway. It was designed by Wilson Worsdell and five locomotives were built between 1900 and 1901 at Gateshead works. The S1 was similar to the NER Class S but had larger driving wheels and a higher boiler pressure. ==Modifications== Schmidt superheaters and longer smokeboxes were fitted between 1913 and 1917. ==Use== When built, the S1s hauled heavy passenger expresses between York, Newcastle, and Edinburgh. They were gradually replaced on these services by NER Class R and NER Class R1 4-4-0s. From 1907, they were mainly used for hauling fish trains. ==Locomotive details== List of NER class S1/LNER class B14 Number(NER/LNER) Built date Withdrawal date Notes 2111 31/12/1900 31/7/1929 2112 30/6/1901 31/5/1931 Last to be withdrawn 2113 30/6/1901 31/10/1930 2114 30/6/1901 31/10/1930 2115 31/8/1901 30/6/1929 First to be withdrawn ==Withdrawal== All five locomotives were withdrawn between 1929 and 1931 and none were preserved. ==References== Category:4-6-0 locomotives S1 Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1900 Category:Scrapped locomotives Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:Passenger locomotives
