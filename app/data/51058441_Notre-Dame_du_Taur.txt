The body was buried where it fell, and an oratory was constructed.Jean- Claude Guidarini, "Grand Orgue de l’église Notre-Dame du Taur (Toulouse)", Toulouse Les Orgues. Toulouse being an important stage on one of the main routes of pilgrimage to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela, pilgrims would pause to honor the saint at his tomb. Eventually, their numbers became so great that in the 11th century, a larger church was built to accommodate them, the present-day Basilica of Saint-Sernin, to which Saturnin's bones were also transferred."Notre-Dame du Taur", pamphlet created with Pastorale des Réalités du Tourisme et des Loisirs. The present building, originally Saint-Sernin du Taur, was constructed between the 14th and 16th centuries.
