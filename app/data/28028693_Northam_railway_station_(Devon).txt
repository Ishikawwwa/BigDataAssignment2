The station stood a little way from the village of Northam. Many of the passengers were golfers on their way to the links on Northam Burrows.Christie, Page 140 ===Infrastructure=== Northam had one platform in length, with a shelter, on the down side of the line. It originally had a short run-around loop, a signal box and one semaphore signal, but with the completion of the extension to Appledore in 1908 it was reduced to a single line without sidings or signalling.Garner, Page 76 A goods yard was provided at one time.Jenkins, Page 61 The line, without gates, crossed Pimpley Road on the level before reaching the Richmond Road request halt. ==Micro history== In January 1901 a one-carriage train ran from Bideford to Northam carrying a few friends of the railway's directors.Baxter, Page 6 Jack Shears, who lived at Northam, was one of the trackmen who worked to maintain the permanent way.Griffith, Page 43 No photographs appear to exist of Northam railway station. == References == ;Notes ;Sources # Baxter, Julia & Jonathan (1980).
