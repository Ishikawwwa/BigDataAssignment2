The territories elected three seats to the Assembly via two electoral colleges; the first college spanned both territories and elected one member, whilst each territory elected one member via the second college. René Malbrant was elected from the first college, with Gabriel Lisette elected from the second college in Chad and Barthélémy Boganda elected in the second college in Ubangi-Shari.Dolf Sternberger, Bernhard Vogel, Dieter Nohlen & Klaus Landfried (1978) Die Wahl der Parlamente: Band II: Afrika, Erster Halbband, p2465 ==Results== ===First college=== ===Second college=== ====Chad==== ====Ubangi-Shari==== ==References== Chad 1946 11 Category:1946 in Ubangi-Shari Chad 1946 11 Category:1946 in Chad Category:November 1946 events in Africa
