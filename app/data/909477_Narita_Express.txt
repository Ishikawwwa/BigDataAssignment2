JR had initially planned to run a high-speed line, the Narita Shinkansen, to a station underneath the main airport terminal. This plan was abandoned in the 1980s, and the space originally slated for the underground station and Shinkansen tracks was used to connect both the JR Narita Line and Keisei Main Line directly to the terminal. The Narita Express began service to the new station on 19 March 1991, and Skyliner switched its service to the new station at the same time. Until March 2004, the Wing Express limited express service was introduced to complement the Narita Express with one return working a day between Ōmiya/Ikebukuro/Shinjuku and Narita Airport. This service was subsequently replaced by an additional Narita Express service. From the start of the revised timetable on 10 December 2005, Narita Express services were made entirely no-smoking. On 1 October 2009, nine new E259 series EMU trains were brought into service on 10 of 26 return Narita Express services, replacing the 253 series. By June 2010 all Narita Express trains were operated by E259 series equipment. From the start of the revised timetable on 13 March 2010, Narita Express service frequencies were increased with more splitting and combining of trains at Tokyo Station. Service is provided between Narita Airport and Tokyo, Shinjuku and Yokohama every 30 minutes during most of the day. All trains operating to/from Shinjuku now stop at , and all trains to/from Yokohama now stop at the new Musashi-Kosugi Station. Narita Express services were suspended from 11 March 2011 due to the effects of the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami and subsequent power supply shortage in the Tokyo area. They were partially restored from 4 April 2011, with the remaining pre-earthquake and tsunami timetable and services finally re-instated on 3 September 2011. Starting in 2014 the Narita Express offered seasonal services on some routes. From , a small number of seasonal trains continued to and on the Yokosuka Line, and from , a small number of seasonal trains continued to and on the Fujikyuko Line. The services to Yokosuka station were discontinued in January 2017 due to low travel numbers, while in March 2019 the Kawaguchiko services were replaced by the new, daily Fuji Excursion limited express. Due a reduction in international travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, on 1 May 2020 service was reduced to a few trains running in the morning and evening. Services between and were cancelled in March 2021. On 12 March 2022 the service partially resumed, however the service no longer extended to or and a number of trains added a stop at . All services resumed on 1 October 2022 prior to Japan lifting its entry restrictions for foreign travelers. Outside of peak commuter times about one out of every two services continue to stop at Chiba, with the others running nonstop between and the airport. ==See also== * List of named passenger trains of Japan ==References== ==External links== *About N'EX (JR East) *E259 series Narita Express (JR East) Category:1991 establishments in Japan Category:Airport rail links in Japan Category:East Japan Railway Company Category:Named passenger trains of Japan Category:Narita International Airport Category:Rail transport in Tokyo Category:Rail transport in Chiba Prefecture Category:Railway lines in Kanagawa Prefecture Category:Railway services introduced in 1991
