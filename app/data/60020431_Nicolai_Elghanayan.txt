He returned for a partial season in the GTS class, earning one win, three additional podium finishes, and two pole positions. His strongest result weekend of note was the Lime Rock Park double header, where he earned both pole positions, his first win, and an additional podium. It was announced in January 2019 that Elghanayan would run his first full Blancpain GT World Challenge America, running a KTM X-BOW in the GT4 America class with MarcoPolo Motorsports. ==Charity work== In 2018, Elghanayan and his father Jeff raised $39,000 for the Tahirih Justice Center, a non- profit national organization that provide legal services, policy advocacy, and training and education to protect immigrant women and girls fleeing gender- based violence. The father and son pair auctioned off VIP experiences at race events, raising enough funds to protect seven women from abuse.
