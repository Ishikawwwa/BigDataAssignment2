Nigloland was created by two brothers, Patrice and Philippe Gélis. The park opened June 1, 1987. The name "Nigloland" comes from its mascot, "Niglo", meaning hedgehog in Romani. The park is divided into four areas: "The Canadian village", "The rock'n'roll village," "The magical village" and "The Swiss village". == History == === Beginnings === Nigloland opened on June 13, 1987, thanks to the initiative of the Gélis brothers Patrice and Philippe, who were inspired by their trip to the United States where they discovered amusement parks with a single entrance ticket The Gélis brothers visited the Walt Disney World Resort in the early 1980s.
