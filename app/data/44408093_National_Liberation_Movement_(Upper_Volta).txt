The National Liberation Movement (, MLN) was a political party in Burkina Faso. ==History== The party was originally established by Joseph Ki-Zerbo in Dakar in Senegal in August 1958. Ki-Zerbo founded the party in order to campaign for a "no" vote in the constitutional referendum in September. After 99% of voters voted for the new constitution, Ki Zerbo moved to Guinea, the only country to oppose the constitution and subsequently become independent.Lawrence Rupley, Lamissa Bangali, Boureima Diamitani (2013) Historical Dictionary of Burkina Faso, Rowman & Littlefield, p139 In 1970 Ki- Zerbo re-established the party to run in the parliamentary elections that year.
